## 🔥 HORMOZI RULES (Read This First)

### The Formula: Make Them Feel Stupid Saying No

**Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood) ÷ (Time × Effort)**

To get fast sales with no "no"s:
1. **Increase Dream Outcome** → They get MORE customers, not just a website
2. **Increase Likelihood** → Guarantee it works or money back
3. **Decrease Time** → 7 days, not weeks
4. **Decrease Effort** → You handle EVERYTHING

### Speed Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Send 50 messages/day minimum | Volume = sales |
| Respond in under 5 minutes | Fast reply = 10x close rate |
| Close same day if possible | Delay kills deals |
| Always have a next step | "I'll send the invoice now" |

### Never Hear "No" Again

**The secret:** Remove all risk from the buyer. Put it on yourself.

- "100% money back if you're not happy"
- "I'll fix it until it's perfect - no extra charge"
- "You don't pay the final 50% until you love it"

**When there's zero risk, there's no reason to say no.**

## GETTING CLIENTS

### Where to Find Them (Best to Worst)

**1. Google Maps (BEST - Endless Supply)**
1. Search: "plumber wyoming"
2. Click on business → No website? → Get phone number
3. Repeat for: electrician, HVAC, roofer, landscaper, painter, etc.
4. Repeat for: Casper, Cheyenne, Laramie, Gillette, etc.

**Trades that PAY (target these):**
- Plumbers ($500-2000/job)
- Electricians ($300-1500/job)
- HVAC ($500-5000/job)
- Roofers ($5000-15000/job)
- Landscapers ($200-2000/job)

**2. Facebook Groups**
- "[City] small business owners"
- Post: "Looking to help 2 local businesses get more customers through their website. DM me if interested."

**3. Reddit**
- r/smallbusiness, r/entrepreneur
- Search "need website" sorted by New
- Reply to hiring posts

**4. LinkedIn**
- Connect with local business owners
- Message after they accept

### Daily Routine (5 hours)

| Time | Action | Volume |
|------|--------|--------|
| Hour 1-2 | Find 50 businesses on Google Maps | 50 prospects |
| Hour 3-4 | Send 50 text messages | 50 messages |
| Hour 5 | Follow up + respond + close | All replies |

**50 messages/day = 2-3 clients/week = $10-15K/month**

## CLOSING SALES

```
Great question! Before I tell you price, here's what you get:

📦 Professional Website Package:

And if you're not 100% happy? Full refund. Zero risk.

Want me to send the invoice?
```

**Key:** Stack value BEFORE price. Make price feel tiny.

### Speed Close (Same-Day Sale)

1. You pay 50% deposit ($998)
2. I start building immediately

### When They Say Yes

Perfect! I'm sending the invoice now.

Once you pay, I'll text you a quick questionnaire 
(takes 2 min) and we start building today.

### 🔥 The "No Brainer" Close

If they hesitate, use this:

```
Here's the deal:

PROJECT SCOPE
- Website Type: [Essential/Professional/Premium]
- Number of Pages: [X]
- Timeline: [X] business days

PRICING
- Total: $[X]
- Deposit: $[X] (50%) - Due before work begins
- Final: $[X] (50%) - Due before site goes live

WHAT'S INCLUDED

- Mobile-friendly

- Basic SEO setup

WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED

REVISIONS - WHAT COUNTS
✅ A revision IS: Color changes, font changes, layout tweaks,

   complete redesigns, or changing the project scope

If you want to add pages or features beyond the original 
scope, I'll quote those separately.

If you're not happy with the design BEFORE we launch, 
you get a full refund of your deposit.

Once you approve the final design and we go live,

I get paid for completed work.

## 🛡️ PROTECTING YOURSELF

### "Unlimited Revisions" - How to Not Get Abused

**What you SAY:** "Unlimited revisions until you're happy"
**What you MEAN:** Tweaks to make it right, not endless rebuilds

**Set expectations early:**
```
Just so you know - revisions means tweaking what we build 
(colors, layout, text, images). If you want to add new pages 
or features later, I'll quote those separately. Fair?
```

**If they abuse it (rare):**
```
Hey, we're on revision #6 now and the requests are getting 
into new territory (adding features we didn't discuss).

Happy to keep going, but this would be an add-on at $150.
Or we can launch what we have and add features later.

What works for you?
```

### Money-Back Guarantee - How to Not Lose Money

**The rule:** Refund available ONLY before launch

**How to say it:**
```
My guarantee: if you don't love the design before we launch, 
full refund. But once you approve and we go live, we're done.

That way you're protected, and I'm protected. Fair?
```

**Why this works:**
- They feel safe trying you (more sales)
- Once they see the preview, they almost never want a refund
- If they DO want a refund, you only lost time, not a launched site
- Launched = proof of work = no chargebacks

### The Numbers

| Scenario | How Often | Your Risk |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Client loves it, pays in full | 90% | None |
| Client wants tweaks, then loves it | 8% | A few hours |
| Client wants refund before launch | 2% | Lost time, kept reputation |
| Client wants refund AFTER launch | <1% | Contract protects you |

**The guarantee MAKES you more money than it costs.**
Without it: fewer people say yes.
With it: more people say yes, almost none ask for refund.

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### 🔥 The Hormozi Rule: Isolate → Solve → Close

**Step 1:** "Is that the ONLY thing stopping you?"
**Step 2:** Solve that one thing
**Step 3:** "Great, so we're good to start?"

---

### "It's too expensive"

```
I hear you. Quick question - is budget the only thing 
holding you back?

[They say yes]

Ok, here's what we can do:

Option 1: Split into 3 payments of $665
Option 2: Start with Essential ($997)
Option 3: I can do $1,800 if you pay today

Also think about this: one new customer from your website 
probably pays for the whole thing. After that, it's profit.

Which option works best?
```

**Key:** Give 3 options. One of them will work.

### "I need to think about it"

```
Totally fair. What specifically do you want to think about?

Is it the price? The timing? Or something else?

[They answer]

[Solve that specific thing]

So if I [solve their concern], are you ready to move forward?
```

**Key:** "Think about it" means they have an objection they didn't say. Find it.

### "I've been burned before"

```
I get it - that's frustrating.

Here's why that won't happen with me:

1. You don't pay the final 50% until you're 100% happy
2. If you hate it, I refund the deposit too
3. I'm local - you can literally find me

Zero risk for you. All the risk is on me.

Does that make you feel better about trying this?
```

**Key:** Name their fear, then remove it completely.

### "I found someone cheaper"

```
Makes sense - price matters.

Quick question: what did they quote you? And what's included?

[They tell you]

Here's the difference:
- Mine comes with a money-back guarantee (do they?)
- I deliver in 7 days (how long is theirs?)
- Unlimited revisions until you love it (do they offer that?)

Cheap websites often cost more long-term when they break 
or don't bring in customers.

But I want to earn your business. If you go with me today, 
I'll match their price. Fair?
```

**Key:** Compete on VALUE, then match price if needed.

### "Not right now"

```
No problem. When IS the right time?

[They say a date]

Perfect - I'll follow up on [date].

But just so you know - I only take 3-5 clients per month. 
If you want to lock in a spot, you can pay a small deposit 
now and we start whenever you're ready.

Would that work?
```

**Key:** Create urgency + offer flexibility.

### "Let me talk to my partner"

```
Of course! What questions do you think they'll have?

[Answer their questions]

Would it help if I put together a one-page summary 
you can show them?

When will you talk to them? I'll follow up right after.
```

**Key:** Arm them to sell for you. Set a specific follow-up time.

## DOWNSELLS (Save the Sale)

| If They Want | Offer Instead | Price |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Professional ($1,997) | Essential | $997 |
| Essential ($997) | Starter | $497 |
| Any package | Payment plan | Split 2-3 payments |

```
No problem! Here's another option:

I have a Starter package for $497. 
It's template-based, but still professional and gets you online.

Would that work better?
```

## THE MATH (Hormozi Speed)

| Action | Volume | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Send 50 texts/day | 50 | 5-10 responses |
| 5-10 responses | ~ | 2-3 serious leads |
| 2-3 leads | ~ | 1 client |

**50 messages = 1 client**
**7 days × 50 messages = 350 messages = 7 clients**
**7 clients × $1,500 avg = $10,500/week**

### Why Volume Wins

| Daily Messages | Weekly Clients | Monthly Revenue |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 20 | 1 | ~$6,000 |
| 50 | 2-3 | ~$15,000 |
| 100 | 5-7 | ~$30,000 |

**More messages = more money. It's that simple.**

## TL;DR - Hormozi Style

### The System

1. **Find 50 businesses without websites** (Google Maps)
2. **Send 50 messages/day** (copy/paste template)
3. **Respond in under 5 minutes** (speed wins)
4. **Stack value, remove risk** (they can't say no)
5. **Send invoice immediately** (don't wait)
6. **Deliver in 7 days** (fast = happy clients)
7. **Upsell hosting** ($49/month recurring)

### The Rules

- **Volume:** 50 messages/day minimum
- **Speed:** Respond in 5 minutes or less
- **Risk:** 100% money-back guarantee (they can't lose)
- **Close:** Always end with "I'll send the invoice now"
- **Follow up:** 3 times minimum before giving up

### Why You Won't Hear "No"

When you offer:
- ✅ A result they want (more customers)
- ✅ Zero risk (money-back guarantee)
- ✅ Fast delivery (7 days)
- ✅ You handle everything

**There's no logical reason to say no.**

The only people who say no:
- Don't have money (offer payment plan)
- Don't believe you (show portfolio + guarantee)
- Don't need it right now (follow up later)

**Solve those 3 and you'll close everyone.**

---

**Stop reading. Start sending messages.**
