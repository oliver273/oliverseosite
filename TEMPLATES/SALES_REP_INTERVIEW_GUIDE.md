## 🎤 THE INTERVIEW PROCESS

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**What to Say:**
```
"Thanks for applying! I'm looking for a commission-only sales rep to help sell website packages. 

Before we start, I want to be transparent: I'm 17, turning 18 on [your birthday]. We'll use a simple agreement now, then upgrade to a formal contract when I turn 18. Terms stay the same, just more formal structure.

Does that work for you?"
```

**Why:**
- Sets expectations
- Shows transparency
- Gets age issue out of the way early
- Most people will say "yes, that's fine"

**If They Say No:**
- They might not be the right person
- Thank them and move on
- Better to find someone who's comfortable with this

---

### Core Questions (10-15 minutes)

**Ask These Questions (in order):**

#### Question 1: "Why do you want to do commission-only sales?"

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Motivation (wants to make money, flexible schedule, etc.)
- ✅ Understanding of commission-only (they know they only get paid if they sell)
- ✅ Realistic expectations (they know it's not guaranteed income)
- ❌ Red flag: "I need guaranteed income" (commission-only isn't for them)
- ❌ Red flag: "I'm not sure, just looking" (not motivated)

**Good Answer Example:**
"I like the flexibility of commission-only. I'm motivated to close sales because that's how I get paid. I understand it's not guaranteed, but I'm confident I can sell."

---

#### Question 2: "How would you find businesses that need websites?"

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Creative ideas (Google searches, social media, directories, etc.)
- ✅ Understanding of target market (small businesses, restaurants, etc.)
- ✅ Specific strategies (not just "I'll look online")
- ❌ Red flag: "I don't know" (hasn't thought about it)
- ❌ Red flag: Vague answers (not prepared)

**Good Answer Example:**
"I'd search Google for '[industry] businesses near me', check Yelp and Google Maps for businesses with bad websites, join Facebook groups for small business owners, and reach out to businesses I find."

---

#### Question 3: "How would you handle someone who says 'it's too expensive'?"

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Sales skills (can handle objections)
- ✅ Understanding of value (focuses on ROI, not just price)
- ✅ Confidence (not defensive)
- ❌ Red flag: "I'd lower the price" (can't negotiate without you)
- ❌ Red flag: "I don't know" (no sales experience)

**Good Answer Example:**
"I'd acknowledge their concern, then focus on the value - how they'll get 3-5x more inquiries, the money-back guarantee, and the ROI. I'd ask what their biggest challenge is and show how we solve it."

---

#### Question 4: "Can you show me an example of how you'd reach out to a business?"

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Communication skills (professional, clear)
- ✅ Personalization (not generic)
- ✅ Value-focused (not just "buy from me")
- ❌ Red flag: Generic spam-like message
- ❌ Red flag: Unprofessional language

**Good Answer Example:**
"Hi [Name], I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a website. I work with OliverSEO, a web design agency that helps businesses get 3-5x more inquiries. Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call? I can show you how to get more customers online."

---

#### Question 5: "What's your availability? How many hours can you commit?"

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Realistic expectations (can commit 5-10 hours/week minimum)
- ✅ Commitment (they're serious about this)
- ✅ Time management (they have time to do this)
- ❌ Red flag: "I'm really busy" (won't have time)
- ❌ Red flag: "Maybe 1-2 hours" (not enough)

**Good Answer Example:**
"I can commit 5-10 hours per week. I'll spend time finding businesses, reaching out, and following up. I'm motivated to make this work."

---

#### Question 6: "Have you done sales before? What was your experience?"

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Honesty (if they have experience, great; if not, that's okay)
- ✅ Relevant experience (sales, customer service, etc.)
- ✅ Learning mindset (willing to learn if no experience)
- ❌ Red flag: Lying about experience (check if it's true)
- ✅ Green flag: No experience but eager to learn (you provide training)

**Good Answer Example:**
"I've done some customer service work, but not formal sales. I'm eager to learn and I'm a quick learner. I'm confident I can do this with the materials and support you provide."

---

#### Question 7: "What happens if a client cancels after paying the deposit?"

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Understanding of claw back (they know commission is on final payment)
- ✅ Realistic expectations (they understand not every deal closes)
- ✅ Professional attitude (they accept it's part of business)
- ❌ Red flag: "That's not fair" (doesn't understand commission structure)
- ❌ Red flag: "I'd still get paid" (doesn't understand terms)

**Good Answer Example:**
"I understand - commission is only paid when the client completes full payment. If they cancel after deposit, no commission is owed. That makes sense and protects both of us."

---

#### Question 8: "How do you prefer to communicate? How quickly can you respond?"

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Professional communication (email, Reddit DM, etc.)
- ✅ Responsive (can respond within 24 hours)
- ✅ Clear communication style
- ❌ Red flag: "I'm not good at responding" (won't work)
- ❌ Red flag: Unreliable communication

**Good Answer Example:**
"I prefer email or Reddit DM. I can respond within 24 hours, usually faster. I'll keep you updated on my progress and any questions I have."

---

### Closing (2-3 minutes)

**What to Say:**
```
"Thanks for your time! I have a few more people to interview, but I'll let you know within [1-2 days] if we'd like to work together.

If we move forward, here's what happens:
1. We'll sign a simple agreement (upgrade to formal contract when I turn 18)
2. I'll send you all the materials (package details, email templates, etc.)
3. You'll start finding businesses and reaching out
4. We'll check in daily

Any questions?"
```

**Why:**
