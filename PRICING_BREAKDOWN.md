## ANSWERING PRICE QUESTIONS

### "Why so expensive?"

```
Good question! Here's what you're getting:

- Custom design (not a template)
- Mobile-friendly on all devices  
- SEO so you show up on Google
- Fast loading (under 3 seconds)
- Unlimited revisions until you're happy
- 100% satisfaction guarantee

Plus, if your site brings in just 2 extra customers, 
it's already paid for itself.
```

### "Can you do it cheaper?"

```
I understand budget is a concern. A few options:

1. Essential package: $997 (simpler site)
2. Payment plan: Split into 2-3 payments
3. Start basic, upgrade later

What works best for you?
```

### "I found someone cheaper on Fiverr"

```
Totally get it. The difference:

- I'm local (Wyoming) - I understand your market
- Direct communication with me (not a team overseas)
- I guarantee results or money back
- Ongoing support when you need changes

You get what you pay for. But if budget is tight,
my Essential package at $997 is competitive.
```
