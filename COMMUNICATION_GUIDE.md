Would you be available for a quick 15-minute call tomorrow to discuss 
your website needs? I find it's easier to understand requirements 
over the phone.

Available times:

Let me know what works for you!

Oliver
```

### Call Scripts:

**Discovery Call:**

you exactly what you need.

Let me ask you a few questions:
1. Tell me about your business - what do you do?
2. Who are your ideal customers?
3. What's the main goal for this website?
4. Do you have any content ready?
5. Any design preferences?
6. What's your timeline?

[Take notes]

Perfect! Based on this, I think the [Package] package would work 
great. Let me create a proposal and send it to you within 24 hours. 
Sound good?"
```

**Design Review Call:**
```
"Hi [Name], I've created the initial design for your website. I've 
sent you a link - can you see it?

[Wait for them to open]

What do you think? Do you like the overall look?

[Get feedback]

Great! I'll make those changes and send you the updated version 
tomorrow. Any other thoughts?"
```

**After Call - Always Send Summary:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great talking with you! Here's a summary of what we discussed:

✅ Key Points:

If you're not ready yet, no problem - just let me know!"
```

- **Set Boundaries:** "I'm happy to help, but let's schedule a call for complex questions"
- **Batch Questions:** "Let me answer all your questions in one email"
- **Use Email:** "Let's continue this via email so I have it documented"

### Client Is Unclear:
