## 🎯 Strategy: Value First, Then Offer

**Never offer free websites.** Instead:
1. Offer free value (audit, consultation)
2. Show you understand their needs
3. Then propose a paid solution

## 💬 FACEBOOK MESSAGE TEMPLATE (For PopArt)

### Option 1: Friendly & Helpful (Recommended)

```
Hi [Business Name]!

I noticed you don't have a website yet, and I wanted to reach out 
because I help small businesses in Wyoming get more customers with 
professional websites.

Quick question - are you getting enough customers finding you online? 
I know a lot of small businesses struggle with that.

I'd love to help if you're interested. I can do a free 15-minute 
website audit - I'll look at your online presence and give you 3 
things that could help you get more customers. No pressure, just 
helpful feedback.

If it makes sense after that, we can talk about building you a 
website. But even if not, you'll get some free advice that could help.

Interested? Just reply here or email me at oliver@oliverseo.com

Thanks!

### Option 2: More Direct (If You Know Them)

```
Hey [Name]!

I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a website yet. I help local 
businesses get more customers with professional websites, and I 
think you'd benefit from one.

I'm taking on 1-2 new clients this week. Would you be interested in 
a quick chat? I can show you what I've done for other Wyoming 
businesses and see if it makes sense for you.

No pressure - just thought I'd reach out!

Best,
Oliver

### Option 3: Super Casual (If You're Friends/Know Them Well)

```
Hey [Name]!

Random question - have you ever thought about getting a website for 
[Business Name]? I build websites for local businesses and I think 
you'd get a lot more customers with one.

I'm doing a few projects this month. Want to chat about it? I can 
show you what I've done for other businesses.

Let me know!
Oliver

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO AFTER THEY RESPOND

### If They Say "Yes, I'm Interested":

**Your Response:**
```
Awesome! I'm excited to help you get more customers.

Quick questions to get started:
1. What's your main goal? (More customers, online presence, etc.)
2. Do you have any content ready? (Photos, logo, business info)
3. What's your timeline? (When do you want it live?)

I have packages starting at $1,500 for a one-page website that gets 
you more calls. But let me understand your needs first, then I'll 
send you a custom proposal.

Want to do a quick 15-minute call to discuss, or would you prefer 
to answer these questions via message?

Thanks!
Oliver
```

### If They Say "I Can't Afford It":

**Your Response:**
```
I totally understand budget is important! Let me ask - how much is 
one new customer worth to you?

If a website brings you just 2-3 more customers per month, and each 
customer is worth $[amount], then a website pays for itself pretty 
quick.

I have a package starting at $1,500 that I can break into payments 
if that helps. Or we could start smaller - maybe just a simple 
one-page site to get you online first, then expand later.

What do you think? Even if it's not right now, I'm happy to help 
when you're ready!

Oliver
```

### If They Say "Maybe Later":

**Your Response:**
```
No problem at all! I totally get it.

When you're ready, I'm here. In the meantime, if you want, I can do 
a free quick audit of your online presence and give you some tips 
that could help even without a website.

Just let me know!

Thanks,
Oliver
```

### If They Say "How Much?":

**Your Response:**
```
Great question! My packages start at $1,500 for a one-page website 
that gets you more calls, up to $6,000 for a full-featured site.

The best package depends on your goals. What's your main objective 
- more customers, showcase your work, online presence?

Once I know that, I can recommend the best package and send you a 
custom proposal with timeline and pricing.

What do you think your main goal would be?

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

### ❌ Don't Offer Free:
- "I'll build you a free website"
- "First client gets it free"
- "I'll do it for exposure"

**Why:** Devalues your work, sets bad precedent, attracts wrong clients

### ❌ Don't Be Too Salesy:
- "You NEED a website NOW!"
- "Your business will fail without one"
- "Limited time offer!"

**Why:** Pushes people away, sounds scammy

### ❌ Don't Be Vague:
- "I can help with websites"
- "Want a website?"
- "I do websites"

**Why:** Doesn't show value, doesn't differentiate you

---

## ✅ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD

### ✅ Offer Value First:
- Free audit
- Free consultation
- Helpful advice

### ✅ Be Specific:
- "I help Wyoming businesses get 2-3x more customers"
- "I build websites that actually get phone calls"
- "I've helped 3 Wyoming businesses already"

### ✅ Show Understanding:
- "I know small businesses struggle with..."
- "I understand budget is important..."
- "I get that you're busy..."
