## STRATEGY 1: FIND UGLY WEBSITES (Fastest Method)

### The Concept
Businesses with BAD websites are ALREADY spending money on their business. They just need someone to show them how bad their site is.

### Step-by-Step (Do This RIGHT NOW)

#### Step 1: Pick a Niche (2 minutes)
Choose ONE:
- Plumbers
- Electricians
- HVAC
- Roofers
- Landscapers
- Dentists
- Chiropractors
- Real estate agents
- Auto repair shops
- Restaurants

**Best niches:** Trades (plumbers, electricians, HVAC) - they have money, hate tech, need leads.

#### Step 2: Find Ugly Websites (30 minutes)

**Google search:**
```
"plumber" + "Wyoming" + "website"
"electrician near me" Wyoming
"HVAC repair" Cheyenne
```

**Look for:**
- Websites that look old (built before 2015)
- Not mobile-friendly
- Slow loading
- No clear call-to-action
- Bad photos
- Wix/Squarespace/GoDaddy builder sites that look amateur

**Make a list of 20-30 businesses with bad websites.**

#### Step 3: Find Their Contact Info (20 minutes)

For each business, find:
- Owner's name (check "About" page or Google their business)
- Email address
- Phone number
- Facebook page

#### Step 4: Send This Message (Copy/Paste)

**Email:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Business Name]'s website

Hi [Name],

I was looking for a [plumber/electrician/etc] in [City] and came across your website.

I noticed a few things that might be costing you customers:
- Your site isn't mobile-friendly (70% of people search on phones)
- It loads slowly (Google penalizes slow sites)
- There's no clear way to request a quote

I'm a web designer and I specialize in helping [trade] businesses get more calls from their website.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to show you what I mean? No pressure, just want to help.

## STRATEGY 5: THE "FREE AUDIT" HOOK

### The Concept
Offer a FREE website audit. This:
1. Provides value upfront
2. Shows your expertise
3. Creates a natural sales conversation
4. Works on ANY platform

### How It Works

**Step 1:** Post or message offering free audits
**Step 2:** They send you their website
**Step 3:** You record a 5-minute Loom video showing problems
**Step 4:** You end with "Want me to fix these for you?"

### Free Audit Script

Record yourself looking at their site:

```
"Hey [Name], I just looked at your website and here's what I found...

1. [Problem 1] - This is costing you customers because...
2. [Problem 2] - Google actually penalizes this...
3. [Problem 3] - This makes it hard for people to contact you...

The good news? These are all fixable. 

If you want, I can put together a proposal to fix everything and get your site working for you instead of against you.

Let me know if you're interested!"
```

**This converts at 30-50%** because you've already shown them the value.

## SCRIPTS FOR COMMON OBJECTIONS

### "It's too expensive"
```
"I understand budget is important. Let me ask - how much is a new customer worth to you?

If your average job is $500, and this website brings you just 3 extra customers a month, that's $1,500/month - $18,000/year.

The website pays for itself in the first month.

Would a payment plan make it easier to get started?"
```

### "I need to talk to my partner/spouse"
```
"Of course! What questions do you think they'll have?

[Answer their questions]

Would it help if I put together a simple one-page summary you can show them?

When do you think you'll have a chance to discuss? I can follow up [day]."
```

### "I'm not ready right now"
```
"No problem at all. When do you think you'll be ready?

In the meantime, can I send you some tips on what to look for in a website?

Also, I only take on 3-5 clients per month. If you want, I can put you on my calendar for [future date] so you don't miss out."
```

### "I've been burned before"
```
"I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?

[Listen]

That's exactly why I offer a 100% money-back guarantee. If you're not happy with the final result, you don't pay.

Plus, I don't disappear - I'm based right here in Wyoming, and you can see my reviews online.

Would that give you enough peace of mind to move forward?"
```
