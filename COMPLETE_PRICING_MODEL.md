## DOWNSELLS (Save the Sale) 📉

When they say "too expensive":

| Original | Downsell To | New Price | What Changes |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Professional $1,997 | Essential | $997 | 1 page instead of 5 |
| Essential $997 | Starter | $497 | Template-based, less custom |
| Any package | Payment plan | Same total | Split into 2-3 payments |
| Any package | Delayed start | 10% off | Start next month |

### Downsell Scripts

**"Too expensive" → Payment Plan:**
```
I understand - it's an investment.

How about we split it into 2 payments?
- $500 now to start
- $497 when we launch

That way it's easier on your budget. Sound good?
```

**"Too expensive" → Smaller Package:**
```
No problem! We can start smaller.

My Essential package is $997 for a 1-page site. 
It has everything you need to start getting customers.

You can always upgrade later when business picks up.
```

**"Too expensive" → Starter:**
```
I get it. Here's another option:

I have a Starter package for $497. 
It's template-based so less custom, but still 
looks professional and gets you online.

Would that work better?
```
