# 🔧 REDDIT POSTING TROUBLESHOOT

## Why You Might Not Be Able to Post on Reddit

### Common Reasons:

**1. Account Age/Karma Requirements:**
- Some subreddits require accounts to be a certain age (e.g., 7-30 days old)
- Some require minimum karma (e.g., 10-100 karma)
- **Solution:** Check subreddit rules, build karma by commenting on posts first

**2. Subreddit Rules:**
- Some subreddits don't allow [HIRING] posts
- Some require you to use specific flairs
- Some have posting restrictions
- **Solution:** Check subreddit rules before posting

**3. Post Format:**
- Some subreddits require specific title formats
- Some don't allow certain words
- **Solution:** Check subreddit rules for posting requirements

**4. Rate Limiting:**
- Reddit may limit posts if you post too quickly
- **Solution:** Wait 10-15 minutes between posts
