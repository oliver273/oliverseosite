Subject: Does [Business Name] have a website?

Hi,

I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a website yet. 

Most businesses without websites are losing customers to competitors who have one. I help local businesses get more customers with professional websites.

I'd be happy to create a free demo site for you to review - no strings attached, just so you can see what's possible.

Interested? Just reply and I'll send you a demo.

Best,
Oliver
