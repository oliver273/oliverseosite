# 🎯 USING A SALES REP TO GET YOUR FIRST CLIENT

## Why This Can Work (Even for First Client)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Someone else does the outreach (saves you time)
- ✅ They're motivated (commission-only = they only get paid if they sell)
- ✅ Multiple people selling = more opportunities
- ✅ You focus on delivery, they focus on sales
- ✅ Low risk (commission-only = no cost if they don't sell)

**The Key:** Make it attractive enough that they WANT to sell for you, even though you don't have testimonials yet.

---

## 💰 COMMISSION STRUCTURE (First Client Special)

### For Your FIRST Client Only:
**Offer 40-50% commission** (higher than normal to attract good salespeople)

**Why Higher Commission:**
- You need proof (first client = testimonial)
- Attracts better salespeople
- They're taking a risk (no track record yet)
- Once you have 1 client, you can lower it to 25-30%

**Example:**
- Essential ($997): 40% = **$399 commission** (you keep $598)
- Professional ($1,997): 45% = **$899 commission** (you keep $1,098)
- Premium ($4,997): 50% = **$2,499 commission** (you keep $2,498)

**After First Client:**
- Lower to 25-30% for future sales
- Tell them: "First client gets you 40-50%, then it's 25-30% ongoing"

```

---

### Step 6: Support Them (Daily Check-ins)

**What to Do:**

1. **Check in daily** (quick message):
   - "How's it going? Any questions?"
   - "How many businesses have you contacted?"
   - "Any leads showing interest?"

2. **Answer questions quickly:**
   - They'll have questions
   - Answer within a few hours
   - Help them close

3. **Provide feedback:**
   - If they share their outreach, give feedback
   - Help them improve

4. **Stay motivated:**
   - Remind them of the commission
   - Celebrate small wins
   - Keep them focused

---

### Step 7: When They Close a Sale

**What Happens:**

1. **They tell you:** "I closed a sale! [Business Name] wants the Essential package."

2. **You confirm:**
   - Get business name, contact info, package choice
   - Verify they're ready to pay

3. **You send Square payment link:**
   - 50% deposit ($498 for Essential)
   - Send to client

4. **Client pays deposit:**
   - You receive payment
   - Start building website
   - **DO NOT pay commission yet** (protects you from claw back)

5. **You deliver website:**
   - Build the website
   - Get final payment (50%)
   - Get testimonial

6. **You pay commission (ONLY after final payment):**
   - Within 7 days of receiving final payment
   - Pay via Square, PayPal, or bank transfer
   - Example: $399 for Essential (40% of $997)
   - **Why this way:** Protects you from claw back if client cancels

7. **Lower commission for next sale:**
   - Tell them: "Great job! Next sale is 25-30% commission."

## 💰 THE MATH

**Scenario: 1 Sales Rep Closes 1 Essential Package**

- Package: $997
- Commission (40%): $399
- You keep: $598

**Is This Worth It?**

✅ **YES, because:**
- You get your first client (proof/testimonial)
- You get $598 (still good money)
- You can lower commission to 25-30% for next sale
- You can hire more salespeople once you have proof

**After First Client:**
- Commission drops to 25-30%
- Example: Next Essential = $249-299 commission (you keep $698-748)
- Much better margins

---

**1. Make Sure You Can Deliver:**
- Before hiring, make sure you can actually build websites

- Pay via Square, PayPal, or bank transfer
