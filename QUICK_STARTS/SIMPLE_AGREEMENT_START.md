2. **Customize it:**
   - Fill in your name/business name
   - Fill in sales rep name

## 📋 WHAT THE SIMPLE AGREEMENT COVERS

**Key Terms:**
- ✅ Commission structure (40-50% first, 25-30% ongoing)
- ✅ Payment timing (on final payment only)
- ✅ What each party does
- ✅ Termination (either party can end)
- ✅ Upgrade plan (formal contract at 18)

**What It Does:**
- Sets clear expectations
- Protects both parties (as much as possible)
- Less formal (avoids some age issues)
- Can start immediately

**What It Doesn't Do:**
- Less legally binding than formal contract
- Still has age issues (but less problematic)
- Will be upgraded at 18
