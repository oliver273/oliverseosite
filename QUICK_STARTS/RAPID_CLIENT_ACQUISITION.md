## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION

### Step 1: Find Your 20 Targets (Day 1 - 2 hours)

**The Method:**

1. **Go to Google Maps**
   - Search: "restaurant [Your City]"
   - Search: "plumber [Your City]"
   - Search: "contractor [Your City]"
   - Search: "HVAC [Your City]"
   - Search: "landscaper [Your City]"
   - Search: "salon [Your City]"

2. **Click on Each Business**
   - Visit their website
   - Check if it's outdated

3. **Look for These Red Flags:**
   - ❌ Looks like it was built in 2010 (weird fonts, bad colors)
   - ❌ Doesn't work well on mobile
   - ❌ Loads slowly
   - ❌ Has "Copyright 2015" or old date in footer
   - ❌ No clear "Call Now" button
   - ❌ No online contact form
   - ❌ Bad design, hard to navigate

4. **Create a Spreadsheet:**
   ```
   Business Name | Website URL | Contact Email | Phone | Notes
   --------------|-------------|---------------|-------|------
   ABC Plumbing  | abc.com     | info@abc.com  | 555...| Bad mobile
   XYZ Restaurant| xyz.com     | hello@xyz.com | 555...| Slow loading
   ```

**Goal:** Find 20 businesses with outdated websites

---

### Step 2: Create Irresistible Mockups (Day 2 - 3-4 hours)

**The Tool:**
- **Durable** (AI website builder - fastest)
- **10Web** (AI website builder)
- **Webflow** (templates)
- **Framer** (templates)
- **Even simpler:** Use a template from HTML5 UP, Bootstrap, or similar

**The Process:**

1. **Take Their Info:**
   - Business name
   - Logo (from their old site)
   - Basic info (services, contact info)

2. **Create Mockup:**
   - Use a modern, professional template
   - Plug in their info
   - Make it look amazing
   - **Crucially:** Create both desktop AND mobile views

3. **Take Screenshots:**
   - Screenshot their current site (mobile view)
   - Screenshot your new mockup (mobile view)
   - Screenshot desktop view too

4. **Create Side-by-Side Comparison:**
   - Use Canva, PowerPoint, or simple image editor
   - Put "BEFORE" (their current site) on left
   - Put "AFTER" (your mockup) on right
   - Add text: "Your Current Site" vs "Your New Site"

**The Result:** You have a powerful visual that shows the transformation

**Time-Saving Tip:**
- Create 1-2 templates for each industry (restaurant, contractor, etc.)
- Reuse templates, just swap out business info
- Much faster than creating from scratch each time

---

### Step 3: Craft the "Limited Time" Offer (Day 2 - 30 min)

**The Offer:**
```
"As part of my local business growth initiative, I'm offering a FREE Premium Logo Design (a $500 value) to the first 5 businesses that sign up for the Professional Package this week."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Creates urgency ("first 5")
- Creates scarcity ("this week")
- High perceived value ($500 bonus)
- Low cost to you (use AI logo maker like Looka, Midjourney, or Canva)

**Alternative Bonuses:**
- Free Google Business setup ($300 value)
- Free social media setup ($400 value)
- Free SEO audit ($500 value)
- Free 3 months hosting ($150 value)

**Pick one bonus that's valuable but easy for you to deliver.**

---

### Step 4: The Personalized Email Campaign (Days 3-7)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Before sending emails, read `STRATEGIES/EMAIL_DELIVERABILITY_GUIDE.md`**
- Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC records (prevents spam)
- Use professional email domain (not Gmail)
- Warm up your email account (2-4 weeks recommended)
- Follow spam-free email best practices

**Send 4 emails per day** to your list of 20.

**Email Template:**

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Question about [Business Name] website"
- "A quick idea for [Business Name]"
- "[Business Name] vs. [Competitor Name] online"
- "Your new website (see attached)"

**Email Body:**

```
Subject: Your new website for [Business Name]

Hi [Owner's Name, if you can find it, otherwise use Business Name],

I was looking for a [plumber/restaurant/etc.] in [Your City] and came across your website.

I have to be honest, it's not doing you justice. On mobile, it's hard to navigate and missing key features that turn visitors into customers.

I specialize in building high-converting websites for local businesses, and I put together a quick mockup of what a modern, lead-generating site could look like for you.

[Attach a PDF or image with a screenshot of their current site and your new mockup side-by-side]

This new design would:
- Load in under 3 seconds
- Feature a prominent "Call Now" button
- Be fully optimized for Google
- Showcase your work and testimonials
- Work perfectly on mobile devices

I'm running a special promotion this week for local businesses. If you sign up for my Professional Package ($1,997), I'll include a complimentary Premium Logo Design (normally $500) to make sure your brand really pops.

This offer is only available for the first 5 businesses that sign up by this Friday.

Would you be open to a quick chat about this?

Best,
[Your Name]
OliverSEO
oliverseo.com

[Your Square Payment Link - "Secure Deposit Here"]
```

**Personalization Tips:**
- Use their actual business name
- Mention something specific about their current site
- Reference their industry
- Make it feel personal, not generic

### Step 5: The Follow-Up & Close

**When They Reply:**

1. **Respond Immediately:**
   - Answer questions via email
   - Be helpful and professional
   - Address concerns

2. **The Close:**
   - Send them to your Square payment link
   - Collect 50% deposit ($998.50 for Professional package)
   - This secures the client

3. **Over-Deliver:**
   - Once they pay, start work immediately
   - Keep them updated via email
   - Deliver on time or early

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- Day 1: Send initial email with mockup
- Day 3: Follow-up email (if no response)
- Day 5: Final follow-up email (if no response)
- Then move on (don't spam)

**What If They Don't Buy?**
- ✅ Add mockup to your portfolio (see `STRATEGIES/PORTFOLIO_MOCKUP_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ Label as "Concept" or "Design Study"
- ✅ Use generic business names if needed
- ✅ Showcase on your website and social media
- ✅ Use in future proposals to close more sales

**Bottom line:** Every mockup is valuable - either as a sale OR as a portfolio piece that attracts more clients.
