## 💬 WHAT TO SAY (Quick Reference)

### When Someone Shows Interest:

**Them:** "I'm interested in a website"

**You:**
```
Awesome! I'm excited to help you get a website that brings in more 
customers.

Quick questions to get started:
1. What's your business name and what do you do?
2. What's your main goal? (More calls, online presence, etc.)
3. Which package interests you? (Essential $1,500-$2,500, Professional 
   $2,500-$4,000, or Premium $4,000-$6,000)

Once I have this, I'll send you a custom proposal within 24 hours!

Best,
Oliver
```

### When They Ask About Price:

**You:**
```
Great question! My packages start at $1,500 for a one-page website 
that gets you more calls, up to $6,000 for a full-featured site.

The best package depends on your goals. What's your main objective 
for the website?

[Then recommend based on their answer]
```

### When They Want to Start:

**You:**
```
Perfect! Here's how it works:

1. I'll send you a proposal with timeline and pricing
2. Once approved, you pay 50% deposit to start
3. I build your website in 5-7 days
4. You review and request revisions
5. Final payment, then I launch it!

Ready to get started? Let me send you that proposal!

Oliver
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### Track These Numbers:
- **Outreach messages sent:** Goal 50+ this week
- **Responses received:** Goal 10+
- **Proposals sent:** Goal 3-5
- **Clients closed:** Goal 1

### Why Track:
- See what's working
- Know where to focus
- Stay motivated (see progress)

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Don't:
- ❌ Wait for "perfect" - start now!
- ❌ Overthink your first client - just get one
- ❌ Give up after 2 days - consistency wins
- ❌ Ignore follow-ups - most sales happen on follow-up
- ❌ Be too salesy - be helpful first

### Do:
- ✅ Start today (even if just 1 message)
- ✅ Follow up 3x before giving up
- ✅ Be helpful, not pushy
- ✅ Track everything
- ✅ Celebrate small wins

---

## 💪 MINDSET

### Remember:
1. **Your work IS good enough** - Your portfolio proves it
2. **You have everything you need** - Tools, process, website
3. **This is a numbers game** - More outreach = more clients
4. **First client is the hardest** - Gets easier after
5. **You can do this** - Many people do this every day

### When You Feel Overwhelmed:
- **Stop. Breathe.**
- **Remember:** You only need 1 client
- **Take action:** Send 1 message
- **Then another:** One at a time
