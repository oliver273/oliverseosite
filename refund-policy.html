        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            At OliverSEO, we are committed to delivering high-quality website design services that meet your business needs. This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which refunds may be issued for our services.
        </p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> We work closely with every client to ensure satisfaction. If you have concerns about your project, please contact us immediately so we can address them before completion.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Refund Eligibility</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Before Work Begins</h3>
        <p>
            If you cancel your project <strong>before any design or development work has started</strong>, you are eligible for a full refund of any deposit paid, minus a 5% processing fee.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refund requests must be made in writing via email to <a href="mailto:oliver@oliverseo.com">oliver@oliverseo.com</a></li>
            <li>Refunds will be processed within 5-10 business days</li>
            <li>Processing fees cover payment processing and administrative costs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. During Development</h3>
        <p>
            Once design or development work has begun, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Partial Refunds:</strong> If you cancel during development, you may be eligible for a partial refund based on the work completed. The amount refunded will be calculated as: (Total Project Cost - Work Completed Value - 10% Cancellation Fee)</li>
            <li><strong>Work Completed Value:</strong> This includes all design work, development hours, content creation, and any third-party services already procured</li>
            <li><strong>Revisions:</strong> Work completed includes all revisions made up to the cancellation date</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you have received deliverables (designs, code, content) that you plan to use, you are not eligible for a refund. The work completed becomes your property upon delivery.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>3. After Project Completion</h3>
        <p>
            Once your website has been completed and delivered, refunds are generally not available. However, we will work with you to resolve any issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If your website has technical problems that prevent it from functioning as specified, we will fix these issues at no additional cost</li>
            <li><strong>Design Concerns:</strong> We offer revision rounds as specified in your package to address design concerns</li>
            <li><strong>Scope Discrepancies:</strong> If the delivered website does not match the agreed-upon scope, we will make necessary adjustments</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Non-Refundable Items</h2>
        <p>The following items are not eligible for refunds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Domain registrations, hosting fees, SSL certificates, or any third-party services already purchased on your behalf</li>
            <li><strong>Completed Work:</strong> Any design, development, or content work that has been completed and delivered</li>
            <li><strong>Rush Delivery Fees:</strong> Additional fees paid for expedited delivery timelines</li>
            <li><strong>Revisions Beyond Package Limits:</strong> Additional revision rounds beyond what's included in your package</li>
            <li><strong>Scope Changes:</strong> Additional features or changes requested beyond the original project scope</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Revision Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Each package includes a specific number of revision rounds:
        </p>

            <li><strong>Essential Package:</strong> 2 rounds of revisions</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Package:</strong> 4 rounds of revisions</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Package:</strong> 6 rounds of revisions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Revisions must be requested within the project timeline. Once the project is marked as complete and delivered, additional revisions may incur additional fees.
        </p>
