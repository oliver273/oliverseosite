## 💰 TURN DEMOS INTO SALES

### **When They Respond:**

**They say: "I like it, how much?"**

**Your response:**
```
Awesome! Here are your options:

**Essential Package - $997**
- Everything you saw in the demo
- 5-7 day delivery
- Mobile-friendly
- SEO optimized
- 100% money-back guarantee

**Professional Package - $1,997** (Most Popular)
- Everything above PLUS:
- Up to 5 pages
- Google Business setup
- 60-day support
- Lead generation guarantee

Which one works for you?

I can send the invoice today and get started immediately.
```

**They say: "Too expensive"**

**Your response:**
```
I understand. Let me ask - what's your biggest concern?

If it's the price, I can offer:
- Payment plan (split into 2-3 payments)
- Starter package ($497) - smaller site, same quality
- Or we can start with just the homepage ($297)

What makes sense for your budget?

The demo you saw took 20 minutes. Imagine what we can do with a full day focused on YOUR business.
```

**They say: "I need to think about it"**

**Your response:**
```
Totally get it. Here's what I can do:

I'll keep your demo live for 48 hours so you can show it to your team/partner.

After that, I'll need to take it down to work on other projects.

Want me to send you the link so you can share it?

[Send demo link]

If you decide to move forward, I can start TODAY and have your site live in 7 days.
```
