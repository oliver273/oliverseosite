I understand. Let me ask - what's your biggest concern?

If it's the price, I can offer:
- Payment plan (split into 2-3 payments)
- Starter package ($497) - smaller site, same quality
- Or we can start with just the homepage ($297)

What makes sense for your budget?

The demo you saw took 20 minutes. Imagine what we can do with a full day focused on YOUR business.
```

**They say: "I need to think about it"**
→ **Your response:**
```
Totally get it. Here's what I can do:

I'll keep your demo live for 48 hours so you can show it to your team/partner.

After that, I'll need to take it down to work on other projects.

Want me to send you the link so you can share it?
