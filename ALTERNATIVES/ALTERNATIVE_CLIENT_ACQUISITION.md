# 🎯 ALTERNATIVE CLIENT ACQUISITION STRATEGIES

**You've exhausted direct outreach. Here's what else works.**

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These Today)

### **1. Optimize What You Already Have (Free)**

**Go Through Your Pipeline:**
- [ ] Re-engage ALL past "no" responses (people's situations change)
- [ ] Follow up with "maybe later" clients (3-5 times - most sales happen on follow-up #3-5)
- [ ] Message businesses that saw your demo but didn't respond (send different angle)
- [ ] Reach out to businesses you contacted 30+ days ago (they might be ready now)

**Re-engagement Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I reached out a few weeks ago about building your website. Just checking in - is this something you're still considering?

I've helped [Number] businesses since we last spoke, and I have some new portfolio pieces I'd love to show you.

Still interested?

- Oliver
```

**Follow-Up Template (For "Maybe Later"):**
```
Hey [Name],

I know you said "maybe later" - just wanted to see if the timing is better now.

I have 2 spots opening up this week. If you're ready, I can start your project TODAY.

If not, no problem - just let me know and I'll follow up in a month.

- Oliver
```

---

### **2. Ask Current/Past Clients for Referrals (Goldmine!)**

**If You Have ANY Clients (Even 1):**

**Email/Template:**
```
Hey [Client Name],

I loved working on your website! Quick question:

Do you know any other business owners who might need a website? I'm looking to help 2-3 more businesses this month.

If you refer someone and they book, I'll give you a $200 credit toward any future work, AND I'll give them 10% off.

Just have them mention your name when they reach out.

Thanks!

- Oliver
```

**Also ask them:**
- Who are your suppliers? (B2B businesses often need websites)
- Who are your customers? (If B2B, their clients might need sites)
- Who do you network with? (Chamber of commerce, business groups)
- Who are your competitors? (They might want sites like yours)

**One happy client = 3-5 referrals if you ask**

---

### **3. Content Marketing (Long-Term, But Works)**

**Create Content That Attracts Clients:**

**TikTok/Instagram Reels (2-3 per day):**
- Before/after website transformations
- "I built this website in 20 minutes" (time-lapse)
- "Common mistakes small businesses make with websites"
- "Why your business needs a website in 2024"
- "I turned down a $500 website - here's why"

**Post Strategy:**
- Every video ends with: "Need a website? DM me!"
- Show your portfolio in every video
- Be consistent (post every day for 2 weeks = traction)

**Blog Posts (If you have a website/blog):**
- "5 Signs Your Business Needs a New Website"
- "How Much Should a Small Business Website Cost?"
- "Website Redesign Case Study: [Client Name]"

**These bring passive leads over time**

---

### **4. Partnerships & Collaborations**

**Partner with People Who Serve Your Clients:**

**Who to Partner With:**
- Business coaches
- Marketing consultants
- Accountants (they know businesses that need websites)
- Real estate agents (they know businesses)
- Insurance agents
- Print shops (they work with small businesses)

**Partnership Proposal:**
```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you work with small businesses. I build websites for local businesses.

Would you be open to a referral partnership? If you refer clients to me, I'll:
- Pay you $200 per referral that books
- Give your clients 10% off their first project
- Only work with businesses you've vetted (quality clients)

Interested in a quick call?

- Oliver
```

**1 partner = 5-10 clients/year**

---

2. Google "[Business Type] [Your City] email"
3. Use Hunter.io (free version: 25 searches/month)
4. LinkedIn Sales Navigator (if you can afford it later)

**Email Template:**
```

If interested, just reply with a good time.

**Where to Go:**

- Farmer's markets (talk to vendors)
- Craft fairs (talk to sellers)

**What to Do:**
- Bring business cards (if you have them)

**One event = 5-10 potential clients**

---

## 💰 PAID CHANNELS (If You Have Budget)

### **1. Facebook/Instagram Ads**

**Budget: $100-200/month**

**Ad Strategy:**
- Target: Business owners in your city, ages 30-60
- Interests: Small business owner, entrepreneur
- Ad copy: "Need a professional website? Starting at $500. Free consultation."

**Ad Creative:**
- Before/after website transformation
- Client testimonial video
- Your portfolio showcase

**ROI: $1,000 in ad spend = $5,000-$10,000 in revenue (if done right)**

---

### **2. Google Ads (When You Have Budget)**

**Budget: $200-500/month**

**Strategy:**
- Target: "[City] website developer", "[City] web design"
- Use your location to your advantage
- Smaller local market = less competition

**Start with $50-100 to test**

---

### **3. Fiverr Ads (When You Turn 18)**

**Fiverr Promoted Gigs:**
- Pay per click (only pay when someone clicks)
- Start with $20-50 budget
- Target your city/niche

**This works once you have a Fiverr account**

---

## 🎯 REFOCUS & OPTIMIZE STRATEGY

### **If You've Messaged Everyone:**

**Time to Focus on:**
1. **Following up** (80% of sales happen after follow-up #3-5)
2. **Building relationships** (content, networking)
3. **Getting referrals** (from current clients)
4. **Positioning yourself** (become the go-to person)

**This Week Focus:**
- [ ] Follow up with EVERYONE in your pipeline (all statuses)
- [ ] Ask current clients for referrals
- [ ] Post on social media 3x/day (attract, don't just pitch)
- [ ] Join 2 networking events
- [ ] Partner with 1-2 service providers

---

## 🔄 THE RETARGETING STRATEGY

### **Re-Engage Everyone:**

**Week 1: All "No" Responses**
- Message all businesses that said "no" with new angle
- "I know you said no before, but I have new portfolio pieces to show you"

**Week 2: All "Maybe Later"**
- Follow up with everyone who said "maybe later"
- Create urgency: "I have 2 spots opening up"

**Week 3: All "Never Responded"**
- Message everyone who didn't respond
- Different angle: "Did you see my last message about [specific benefit]?"

**Week 4: All "Demo Sent But No Response"**
- Follow up: "Did you get a chance to see the demo? It expires tomorrow"

**People's situations change. Don't assume "no" means "never"**

---

## 📊 LEVERAGE WHAT'S WORKING

### **Analyze Your Pipeline:**

**Which outreach method worked best?**
- Facebook groups?
- Google Maps messages?
- Reddit?
- TikTok/Instagram?

**Double down on what worked:**
- If Facebook groups worked → Join 10 more groups
- If Reddit worked → Post in 10 more subreddits
- If Instagram worked → Post 5x/day instead of 2x

**If TikTok got responses:**
- Create 10 more videos
- Use trending sounds
- Show more portfolio pieces
