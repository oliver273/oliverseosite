# Free Website Giveaway Funnel - Hormozi Style

## The Strategy

**Give away free websites → Build email list → Upsell on hosting/domain/maintenance → Convert to paid clients**

This is how Hormozi would do it. It's a loss leader strategy that builds massive trust and creates a pipeline of paying customers.

---

## Why This Works (Hormozi Principles)

### 1. Lead Magnet = Free Website
- **Value:** $1,500+ (huge perceived value)
- **Cost to you:** 3-5 hours of work
- **What you get:** Email, phone, business info, TRUST

### 2. The Real Money Is In:
- Domain registration ($15/year → charge $50-100/year)
- Hosting ($5-20/month → charge $50-150/month)
- Maintenance ($0 cost → charge $50-200/month)
- Future projects (redesigns, additional pages, SEO)

### 3. Lifetime Value Math:
| Free Client | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total LTV |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Domain | $50 | $50 | $50 | $150 |
| Hosting | $1,200 | $1,200 | $1,200 | $3,600 |
| Maintenance | $1,200 | $1,200 | $1,200 | $3,600 |
| **Total** | **$2,450** | **$2,450** | **$2,450** | **$7,350** |

**You give away a "free" $1,500 website, but make $7,350 over 3 years.**

---

## Step 2: Create the Landing Page

### Landing Page Structure:

---

## Step 4: The Math (Hormozi Style)

### Cost Per Lead (If Running Ads):
- Ad spend: $500/month
- Cost per lead: $5-10 (let's say $10)
- Leads per month: 50

### Conversion:
- 50 leads → 10 applications (20%)
- 10 applications → 5 free websites (50%)
- 5 free websites → 4 on hosting (80%)

### Revenue:
- 4 clients × $149/month = $596/month recurring
- Year 1: $596 × 12 = $7,152
- Minus ad spend: $7,152 - $6,000 = **$1,152 profit Year 1**

### Year 2+ (No More Ad Spend for These Clients):
- 4 clients × $149 × 12 = **$7,152 pure profit**

### Scale:
- Month 1: 4 clients = $596/month
- Month 2: +4 = 8 clients = $1,192/month
- Month 3: +4 = 12 clients = $1,788/month
- Month 6: 24 clients = $3,576/month
- Month 12: 48 clients = **$7,152/month recurring**

**After 1 year: $7,152/month = $85,824/year RECURRING**

---

## Step 5: Video Ad Strategy

### Video 1: The Hook (15-30 seconds for TikTok/Reels)
```
"I'm giving away 5 FREE professional websites this month.

Normally $1,500. Yours FREE.

I'll design it, build it, make it mobile-friendly, add SEO...

All you pay is $99/month for hosting.

Link in bio to apply. Only 5 spots."
```

### Video 2: The Build (Show Your Work)
- Timelapse of you building a website
- Text overlay: "Building a FREE website for [Business Name]"
- End CTA: "Want one? Link in bio"

### Video 3: The Testimonial
- Before/after of a free website
- Client quote (even if text-based)
- CTA: "Apply for your free website"

### Video 4: The Objection Handler
```
"People ask: Why are you giving away free websites?

Here's the truth:
1. I'm building my portfolio
2. You pay for hosting ($99/month)
3. If you love it, you might hire me for more

Win-win. Link in bio."
```

## Step 6: Email List Nurture

### When They Apply But Don't Convert:

**Email 1 (Day 1):** "Thanks for applying!"
- Confirm their application
- Tell them you'll review and get back

**Email 2 (Day 2):** "Here's what your website could look like"
- Send portfolio examples
- Build excitement

**Email 3 (Day 3):** "Only 2 spots left"
- Urgency
- CTA to book a call

**Email 4 (Day 5):** "Last chance"
- Final scarcity push

**Email 5 (Day 7):** "Offer closed, but..."
- Offer a discount on paid package
- "Since you missed the free offer, here's 50% off your first 3 months"

### For Non-Converters (Long-term):
- Weekly tips on growing their business
- Case studies
- New offers
- Eventually convert to paid

---

## Step 7: Referral Engine

### After Free Website Is Live:

**Ask for:**
1. Testimonial (video or text)
2. Google review
3. Referrals

**Referral Offer:**
"Know someone who needs a website? Refer them and get 1 month free on your hosting."

**Each free client should generate 1-2 referrals.**

---

## Step 8: Upsell Pipeline

### After 1-3 Months, Offer:
1. **Additional pages** ($200-500 each)
2. **Blog setup** ($300-500)
3. **SEO package** ($300-500/month)
4. **Social media integration** ($200-300)
5. **E-commerce features** ($500-1,000)
6. **Full redesign** ($1,500-3,000)

**Average client spends $500-2,000 in first year on extras.**

---

## Quick Start: Free vs Paid Ads

### Option A: Free Content First (No Budget)
1. Post videos on TikTok, Reels, YouTube
2. "Free website giveaway" in video
3. Link to application form
4. Convert organically

**Pros:** No cost, builds audience
**Cons:** Slower, less predictable

### Option B: Paid Ads ($500-1,000/month)
1. Run Facebook/Instagram ads
2. Target small business owners, entrepreneurs
3. Send to landing page
4. Convert faster

**Pros:** Faster, scalable, predictable
**Cons:** Costs money, need to learn ads

### Recommended: Start Free, Add Paid Later

- Charge $149/month hosting
- Year 1: $1,788 (MORE than one-time sale)
- Year 2: Another $1,788
- Year 3: Another $1,788
- Plus upsells, referrals

**The "free" website makes you MORE money over time.**

## Remember

Hormozi's key insight: **"Give away the thing everyone else charges for, and charge for the thing everyone else gives away."**

- Others charge for websites → You give them free
- Others give free hosting → You charge for it
- Result: You get more clients, more recurring revenue
