# Free Website Giveaway Funnel

## The Strategy

**Give away 1 free website** → **Build email list** → **Upsell domain/hosting** → **Convert to paid clients**

This is a lead magnet funnel that builds trust and gets you paying customers.

---

## How It Works

```
VIDEO ADS → LANDING PAGE → FREE GIVEAWAY → EMAIL LIST → UPSELLS → PAID CLIENTS
```

### Step 1: Create Video Ads
- Record yourself building a website
- Show the value of what you do
- Drive traffic to your landing page

### Step 2: Landing Page
- "Enter to win a FREE $2,500 website"
- Collect emails
- Build your list

### Step 3: Pick a Winner
- Give away 1 free website
- EVERYONE else gets an offer
- "You didn't win, but here's 50% off"

### Step 4: Upsell Winners
- Free website, BUT...
- Domain: $15/year
- Hosting: $10-20/month
- Maintenance: $50-100/month

### Step 5: Convert Losers
- "You didn't win, but..."
- Special offer for entrants
- They're already warm leads

---

## The Math

### Giveaway Math:
- **Cost to you:** 5-10 hours building 1 free site
- **What you get:** 100-500 email leads
- **Conversion rate:** 2-5% become paying clients
- **Result:** 2-25 clients from 1 giveaway

### Example:
- 200 people enter giveaway
- 1 person wins (free site + upsells)
- 199 people get "consolation offer" (30-50% off)
- 10 people (5%) take the offer
- **10 clients × $1,500 = $15,000**

## Part 1: Video Ads

### Video Ideas for Ads:

#### Video 1: "I'm Giving Away a FREE $2,500 Website"
```
Hook (first 3 seconds):
"I'm giving away a $2,500 website for FREE."

I'm picking ONE business to build a completely free professional website.

Here's what you'll get:

```

#### Video 2: Timelapse Ad
```
[Show timelapse of you building a website - 15-30 seconds]

Text overlay:
"I'm giving away a FREE website like this"
"Enter to win - link in bio"
```

[Show a bad website]
"This is what most small business websites look like"

```

### Where to Run Ads:

## Part 5: Upsells for the Winner

### The "Free" Website Upsells:

Even though the website is free, they need:

#### 1. Domain Name ($15-20/year)
```
"You'll need a domain name (yourwebsite.com).
I can set this up for you for $20/year.
Or you can buy it yourself at Namecheap/GoDaddy."
```

#### 2. Hosting ($10-30/month)
```
"Your website needs hosting to be live online.
I offer hosting for $15/month which includes:
- Fast servers
- SSL certificate
- Daily backups
- 99.9% uptime

Or you can use your own hosting."
```

#### 3. Monthly Maintenance ($50-100/month)
```
"Want me to keep your website updated and secure?

Monthly maintenance includes:
- Security updates
- Backup management
- Small content changes
- Technical support
- Performance monitoring

Only $75/month."
```

#### 4. Additional Pages/Features
```
"Your free website includes 5 pages.
Need more? Additional pages are $100 each.
Need special features? Let's discuss pricing."
```

### Revenue from "Free" Website:

| Upsell | Price | Your Revenue |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Domain | $20/year | $5-10 profit |
| Hosting | $15/month | $10-12/month profit |
| Maintenance | $75/month | $75/month profit |
| Extra pages | $100 each | $100 each |

**Potential from 1 "free" website:**
- Year 1: $20 + ($15 × 12) + ($75 × 12) = $1,100/year
- Ongoing: $90/month = $1,080/year

Oliver
```

### Day 7: Value Email
```
Subject: Why your competitors are getting more customers

Hey [Name],

Quick question: How are customers finding you online?

If you don't have a website (or have an outdated one), you're losing customers to competitors who do.

Here's what a professional website does:
- Shows up when people Google your service
- Builds trust before they even call
- Works for you 24/7

I'm still offering a special rate for giveaway entrants: 30% off any package.

Interested? Reply and let's chat.

Oliver
```

### Day 14: Check-In
```
Subject: Still need a website?

Hey [Name],

I noticed you entered my giveaway but haven't gotten your website yet.

Is there something holding you back?

- Budget? (I offer payment plans)
- Time? (I handle everything)
- Not sure what you need? (Let's chat)

Reply and let me know - I'm here to help.

Oliver
```
