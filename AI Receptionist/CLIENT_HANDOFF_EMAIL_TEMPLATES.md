## ✅ Email 1: Project Completion & Ready to Implement

**Subject:** AI Receptionist System - Ready for Implementation

**To:** Kody@mwfbi.com  
**CC:** [Add Mike's email if you have it]

**Body:**

Hi Kayleigh,

I hope this email finds you well!

I'm excited to let you know that your AI receptionist system is **complete and ready for implementation**. 

**What's Been Set Up:**
✅ AI receptionist configured for off-hours calls (after 5pm Mon-Thu, after 4pm Fri, weekends)
✅ Real-time data collection (name, phone, email, reason for calling)
✅ Google Sheets integration (all call data automatically logged)
✅ Email notifications (real-time delivery to your email)
✅ Custom script optimized for your business needs
✅ Tested and working properly

**Next Steps:**
1. **Phone Number Setup:** We'll need to configure which phone line to use for the AI
2. **Final Testing:** I can walk you through a test call to make sure everything works perfectly
3. **Go Live:** Once you approve, we can activate the system

**Questions:**
- What's the best time to schedule a quick call to go over the setup?
- Do you have a specific phone line/number you'd like to use for the AI?
- Is there anything specific you'd like me to adjust before we go live?

I'm available to help with the implementation whenever you're ready. Just let me know what works best for you!

Best regards,

## 📞 Email 3: Request for Mike's Contact Info (If Needed)

**Subject:** Quick Question - Billing Contact

**To:** Kody@mwfbi.com

**Body:**

Hi Kayleigh,

I hope you're doing well!

I have the AI receptionist system ready to go, and I wanted to reach out about a couple of things:

1. **Project Completion:** The system is ready for implementation - would you like me to send you the details, or should I contact Mike directly?

2. **Billing:** For invoicing purposes, could you provide Mike's direct email address? Or would you prefer I send the invoice to you and you can forward it?

3. **Implementation:** What's the best way to coordinate the final setup and go-live?

Thanks so much for your help!

Best regards,
