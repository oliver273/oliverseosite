AI Receptionist for Small Businesses | Your AI Answers Calls 24/7, Captures Leads, Emails You Instantly | No Contracts | OliverSEO
```

## 2. ABOUT SECTION
*(Click "About" → Edit → paste this)*

```
Every missed call is a missed customer.

I build AI receptionists that answer your business phone 24/7 — nights, weekends, and holidays. The AI sounds natural (most callers can't tell it's AI), collects the caller's name, phone number, email, and reason for calling, then emails everything to your team within 30 seconds.

No more voicemail. No more "Sorry, we're closed." No more waking up to realize you lost a lead at 9 PM last night.

Here's how it works:
→ Someone calls after hours
→ The AI answers professionally, has a real conversation, and collects their info
→ You get an email + Google Sheets entry immediately
→ You follow up on your schedule with a warm lead instead of a cold voicemail

One flat rate. No setup fees. No contracts. Month-to-month.

I work with insurance agencies, law firms, real estate offices, HVAC companies, medical practices, and any business that can't afford to miss calls.

Want to hear it for yourself? Call our live demo line: (307) 464-9517 — available 24/7.

- Business casual or better
- Smile — you're selling trust

## WHAT TO DO AFTER UPDATING:

1. **Post an announcement** — Something like:

2. **Connect with local business owners** — Search for business owners in Gillette/Wyoming and send connection requests

3. **Join groups** — Search for groups like "Small Business Owners," "Insurance Agents," "Real Estate Agents," "HVAC Contractors" and join them

4. **Comment on posts** — Engage with people in your target industries. Don't pitch — just be helpful. The profile does the selling.
