### Performance Target
- Provider targets a **95% or higher successful call handling rate** (defined as calls where the AI correctly collects the caller's name, phone number, and reason for calling)

### What Counts as a Failed Call

- AI fails to capture name or phone number ❌
- AI produces a confusing or frustrating experience for the caller ❌

### Issue Resolution
- Provider monitors calls regularly and proactively fixes issues — often before the Client notices
- When a call quality issue is identified, Provider will implement a fix within **24 hours**
- Client may report any quality issues to Provider at any time via email or text

### Monthly Quality Reporting
- Provider will include call quality metrics in the monthly recap email
- If the success rate drops below 90% in any given month, Provider will perform a full review and present a corrective action plan within 5 business days
