# Sales Call Script — AI Receptionist Service

> Use this when a prospect replies to your cold email, calls your demo line, or you get a referral.
> Goal: Book them or close them on the same call.

---

## 1. OPENING (30 seconds)

**If they replied to your email:**
> "Hey [Name], thanks for getting back to me! I saw you're with [Company Name]. I help businesses like yours make sure they never miss a call — even after hours. Do you have a couple minutes? I'd love to learn a bit about how you're handling calls right now."

**If they called your demo line:**
> "Hey! Thanks for calling in. So you just talked to Claire — that's our AI receptionist demo. Pretty cool right? I'm Oliver, I'm the one who builds these. What's your name and what kind of business are you running?"

**If it's a referral from Mike:**
> "Hey [Name], Mike [or whoever referred] mentioned you might be interested in what we set up for his office. He's been using our AI receptionist at Mountain West Farm Bureau — basically it answers every call they miss, collects info, and emails it to his team instantly. Want me to walk you through how it works?"

## 2. DISCOVERY — Ask These Questions (2-3 min)

The goal here is to find their PAIN. Don't pitch yet — just listen.

1. **"How are you handling calls right now when you're busy or after hours?"**
   - Listen for: voicemail, missed calls, answering service, receptionist

2. **"How many calls would you say you miss in a week?"**
   - Listen for: any number above 5 = strong lead

3. **"What happens when you miss those calls? Do people usually call back?"**
   - Listen for: lost clients, frustrated customers, bad reviews

4. **"Have you tried anything else to fix this?"**
   - Listen for: expensive answering services, part-time staff, nothing

5. **"If you could wave a magic wand, what would the perfect solution look like?"**
   - This gets them to describe exactly what you sell

## 3. THE PITCH (2 min)

> "So here's what I built — it's an AI receptionist that answers your phone 24/7. It sounds like a real person, not a robot. It greets callers, collects their name, phone number, email, and reason for calling, and then instantly sends your team an email with all that info plus a full transcript and recording of the call.
>
> You never miss a lead. Your callers get a professional experience. And you don't have to pay someone $15-20/hour to sit by a phone.
>
> I actually have a demo line you can call right now if you want to hear it — **(307) 464-9517**. That's Claire, she'll walk you through exactly what your callers would experience."

**If they already called the demo:**
> "So what Claire just did for you — collecting your info quickly and professionally — that's exactly what your callers would get. Plus your team gets an instant email with everything: name, phone, email, reason for calling, transcript, and a recording."

## 4. PRICING (2 min)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always anchor BEFORE you say your price. Set the frame first.**

> "So let me walk you through the options out there right now.
>
> If you hired a part-time receptionist just for after-hours, you're looking at **$1,600 to $2,100 a month** — and they can only cover 20 hours a week, they call in sick, need training, the whole thing.
>
> A traditional answering service — humans reading scripts — that runs **$2,000 to $4,000 a month** for the volume you'd need. And they often batch their reports, so you don't get info right away.
>
> I have two options for you:
>
> **Option 1 — Pay-Per-Use.** **$200 a month** base, which includes 200 minutes. After that it's **90 cents a minute**. A typical call is 2-3 minutes, so you're looking at about **$2-3 per lead captured**. There's a one-time $1,500 setup fee and a 3-month minimum — after that it goes month-to-month. And the AI can even book appointments right into your calendar.
>
> **Option 2 — Pro.** **$1,700 a month, flat.** That includes 3,000 call minutes, no setup fee, appointment booking, instant email delivery after every call with the full transcript and recording, and I personally monitor and optimize it for you every month. That works out to **$57 a day** — less than one hour of a human receptionist.
>
> Both plans include 24/7 coverage, appointment booking, email delivery, transcripts, recordings, Google Sheets integration, and monthly optimization. The only question is — do you want to start small or lock in the flat rate?"

**If they lean toward Pay-Per-Use:**
> "Great choice to start. You get 200 minutes included in that $200 base — most businesses with light after-hours traffic stay well under that. And here's the thing — if your call volume picks up and you're spending over $1,700 a month anyway, I'll move you to the flat rate and save you money. I'll actually tell you when it makes sense to switch."

**If they react to the price (sticker shock on Pro):**
> "That's why I have the pay-per-use option. $200 a month with 200 minutes included — that covers most small businesses. If you get 20 calls a month at 3 minutes each, that's only 60 minutes — well within your included minutes. You're literally paying to capture leads that could be worth thousands."

**The daily cost reframe (for Pro):**
> "Think of it this way — $57 a day for a receptionist that never sleeps, never calls in sick, never takes a holiday, books appointments, and emails your team instantly after every single call."

**The per-lead reframe (for Pay-Per-Use):**
> "At $200 a month with 200 minutes included, you're paying about $2-3 per lead captured. Compare that to a missed call that goes to voicemail — 80% of callers won't leave a message. That lead is just gone."

**If they're in healthcare (HIPAA pitch):**
> "Since you're in healthcare, I should mention — we also offer full HIPAA compliance as an add-on. That's an extra $2,000 a month, but it means all your patient calls are handled securely and you stay fully compliant. Most AI services can't even offer that."

## 5. HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "That's too expensive" / "That's more than I expected"
> "What were you expecting, if you don't mind me asking?" [Let them answer — this tells you their budget and lets you reframe.]
>
> Then: "I totally get it. That's actually why I built the pay-per-use option — no monthly fee, just 90 cents a minute when the AI is actually on a call. A typical 3-minute call costs you $2.70 to capture a lead. If that lead is worth even $500 to your business, that's a 185x return. And if you get zero calls, you pay zero. There's literally no risk."
>
> If they still want the Pro plan but are hesitant: "A part-time receptionist after hours runs $1,600-$2,100 a month and can't work 24/7. An answering service is $2,000-$4,000. At $1,700 flat, this is actually the most affordable 24/7 option on the market."

### "Can you do it for less?"
> "Absolutely — the pay-per-use plan has no monthly fee at all. You just pay 90 cents a minute for actual call time. Or if you want the flat rate, the $1,700 includes everything — the instant email delivery and monthly optimization are what actually make it work for your business. Without those, it's just a fancy voicemail."

### "I need to think about it"
> "Of course, no pressure at all. What specifically do you want to think through? Is it the price, the tech, or something else? I just want to make sure I've answered everything."
>
> If they're still hesitant: "How about this — I can set up a test run for you. You see every call it handles, every email it sends. Then we can talk numbers once you've seen it in action. Sound fair?"

### "I need to talk to my partner/spouse/team"
> "Absolutely. Want me to send you a one-page breakdown? It shows the cost comparison vs hiring a receptionist vs an answering service, plus the ROI math. That way they can see the numbers and you don't have to explain it all."

### "Isn't this just a glorified voicemail?"
> "That's the best question anyone asks — and the answer is no, not even close. Here's the difference: 80% of people won't leave a voicemail. They hang up and call your competitor. But the AI actually ANSWERS — it says 'Hi, how can I help you?' and has a real conversation. It asks their name, phone, email, what they need, and then emails everything to your team in 30 seconds. A voicemail just says 'leave a message at the beep' and prays someone talks. Call our demo line right now — (307) 464-9517 — and you'll hear the difference in 5 seconds."

### "Can I try it first?"
> "Absolutely. Call **(307) 464-9517** right now and you'll talk to Claire — she's our demo AI. That'll give you a feel for exactly what your callers would experience."

### "I already have a receptionist"
> "That's great! This isn't about replacing them — it's about catching everything they can't. After hours, weekends, holidays, lunch breaks, when they're on another call. The AI handles all of that so your receptionist can focus on in-person clients."

### "How do I know it works?"
> "I've got it running right now for a Farm Bureau insurance office in Wyoming. It's handling all their after-hours calls, collecting caller info, and emailing everything to their team automatically. I can also set up a trial so you can see it with your own calls."

### "What if callers don't like talking to an AI?"
> "Great question. The voice is super natural — most callers don't even realize it's AI. It uses the latest voice technology, not a robotic text-to-speech. You can hear it yourself at **(307) 464-9517**. People are honestly surprised."

### "I can get an AI receptionist online for $200/month"
> "You absolutely can — and here's the difference. Those are DIY platforms. You sign up, you figure out the setup yourself, you write your own prompts, you troubleshoot when something breaks at 2 AM, and you get a generic AI that sounds like everyone else's.
>
> What I do is completely different. I build a custom AI for YOUR business — with your greeting, your call flow, your industry knowledge. I set everything up for you, I monitor every call to make sure it's working, and I optimize it every month based on real data. When something goes wrong, I fix it before you even notice.
>
> Those $200 tools are like buying a DSLR camera and learning photography yourself. I'm the photographer who shows up, takes the photos, and hands you the finished product.
>
> And honestly, if you look at the math — those platforms charge per minute too. At 3,000 minutes, most of them end up costing $1,200-$1,500 anyway, and you're still doing all the work yourself. For a couple hundred more, I handle everything."

### "My buddy / nephew / IT guy says they can build this for me"
> "They probably can — Vapi, Bland, a dozen platforms out there can technically do this. The question is: will they be there at 11 PM on a Saturday when the AI mispronounces your company name and a real customer is on the line? Will they optimize the prompts every month based on actual call data? Will they set up the email delivery, the Google Sheets integration, the call recordings?
>
> I've already built this, it's already running, and you can hear it right now — (307) 464-9517. The difference between 'can build it' and 'already built and running for real businesses' is about 40 hours of work and a lot of trial and error."

## 6. THE CLOSE

### If they're warm:
> "So here's what I'd suggest — I can have your AI receptionist built and ready to go within a week. I'll customize it for your business, set up the email notifications to your team, and make sure everything's dialed in. Want to get started?"

### If they need a nudge:
> "Tell you what — let's do this. I'll build it out for you, we'll test it together, and if it's not exactly what you want, we'll adjust it until it is. The first invoice doesn't go out until you're happy with how it sounds. Fair enough?"

### After they say yes:
> "Awesome! Here's what I need from you to get started:
> 1. Your business name and a brief description of what you do
> 2. The email address(es) where you want call notifications sent
> 3. Any specific info you want the AI to collect from callers
> 4. Your preferred greeting style — professional, friendly, casual
>
> I'll have a first version ready for you to test within a few days."

## TIPS

- **Listen more than you talk** — the prospect should be talking 60% of the time
- **Always redirect to the demo line** — hearing is believing
- **Use Mike as a case study** — "I'm already running this for a Farm Bureau office in Wyoming"
- **Don't discount** — if they push back on price, offer Pay-Per-Use instead of lowering the Pro rate
- **Follow up within 24 hours** if they say "let me think about it"
- **Ask for referrals** after every happy client
