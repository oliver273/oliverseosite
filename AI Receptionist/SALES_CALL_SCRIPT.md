# Sales Call Script — AI Receptionist Service

> Use this when a prospect replies to your cold email, calls your demo line, or you get a referral.
> Goal: Book them or close them on the same call.

---

## 1. OPENING (30 seconds)

**If they replied to your email:**
> "Hey [Name], thanks for getting back to me! I saw you're with [Company Name]. I help businesses like yours make sure they never miss a call — even after hours. Do you have a couple minutes? I'd love to learn a bit about how you're handling calls right now."

**If they called your demo line:**
> "Hey! Thanks for calling in. So you just talked to Claire — that's our AI receptionist demo. Pretty cool right? I'm Oliver, I'm the one who builds these. What's your name and what kind of business are you running?"

**If it's a referral from Mike:**
> "Hey [Name], Mike [or whoever referred] mentioned you might be interested in what we set up for his office. He's been using our AI receptionist at Mountain West Farm Bureau — basically it answers every call they miss, collects info, and emails it to his team instantly. Want me to walk you through how it works?"

## 2. DISCOVERY — Ask These Questions (2-3 min)

The goal here is to find their PAIN. Don't pitch yet — just listen.

1. **"How are you handling calls right now when you're busy or after hours?"**
   - Listen for: voicemail, missed calls, answering service, receptionist

2. **"How many calls would you say you miss in a week?"**
   - Listen for: any number above 5 = strong lead

3. **"What happens when you miss those calls? Do people usually call back?"**
   - Listen for: lost clients, frustrated customers, bad reviews

4. **"Have you tried anything else to fix this?"**
   - Listen for: expensive answering services, part-time staff, nothing

5. **"If you could wave a magic wand, what would the perfect solution look like?"**
   - This gets them to describe exactly what you sell

## 3. THE PITCH (2 min)

> "So here's what I built — it's an AI receptionist that answers your phone 24/7. It sounds like a real person, not a robot. It greets callers, collects their name, phone number, email, and reason for calling, and then instantly sends your team an email with all that info plus a full transcript and recording of the call.
>
> You never miss a lead. Your callers get a professional experience. And you don't have to pay someone $15-20/hour to sit by a phone.
>
> I actually have a demo line you can call right now if you want to hear it — **(307) 464-9517**. That's Claire, she'll walk you through exactly what your callers would experience."

**If they already called the demo:**
> "So what Claire just did for you — collecting your info, reading it back, confirming everything — that's exactly what your callers would get. Plus your team gets an instant email with everything: name, phone, email, reason for calling, transcript, and a recording."

## 4. PRICING (2 min)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always anchor BEFORE you say your price. Set the frame first.**

> "So let me walk you through the options out there right now.
>
> If you hired a part-time receptionist just for after-hours, you're looking at **$1,600 to $2,100 a month** — and they can only cover 20 hours a week, they call in sick, need training, the whole thing.
>
> A traditional answering service — humans reading scripts — that runs **$2,000 to $4,000 a month** for the volume you'd need. And they often batch their reports, so you don't get info right away.
>
> What I built runs **$1,700 a month, flat**. That includes 24/7 coverage, up to 3,000 call minutes, instant email delivery after every call with the full transcript and recording, and I personally monitor and optimize it for you every month. No setup fees, no hidden costs.
>
> It works out to about **$57 a day** — that's literally less than one hour of a human receptionist's time, but the AI works all 24 hours.
>
> If you ever go over 3,000 minutes, it's just $0.30 per extra minute — but honestly, most businesses don't even come close."

**If they react to the price (sticker shock):**
> "I hear you — let me ask you this. How many calls do you think go to voicemail after hours or on weekends? Even if ONE of those people per month would've become a client — one auto policy, one home policy — that commission alone covers the entire cost. Everything after that is pure profit."

**The daily cost reframe:**
> "Think of it this way — $57 a day for a receptionist that never sleeps, never calls in sick, never takes a holiday, and emails your team instantly after every single call."

## 5. HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "That's too expensive" / "That's more than I expected"
> "What were you expecting, if you don't mind me asking?" [Let them answer — this tells you their budget and lets you reframe.]
>
> Then: "I get it. But here's the thing — a part-time receptionist after hours runs $1,600-$2,100 a month and can't work 24/7. An answering service is $2,000-$4,000. At $1,700, this is actually the most affordable 24/7 option on the market. And if it catches even one extra client a month for you, it pays for itself."

### "Can you do it for less?"
> "I could strip features — but the instant email delivery and monthly optimization are what actually make it work for your business. Without those, it's just a fancy voicemail. I'd rather give you the full package that actually makes you money."

### "I need to think about it"
> "Of course, no pressure at all. What specifically do you want to think through? Is it the price, the tech, or something else? I just want to make sure I've answered everything."
>
> If they're still hesitant: "How about this — I can set up a test run for you. You see every call it handles, every email it sends. Then we can talk numbers once you've seen it in action. Sound fair?"

### "I need to talk to my partner/spouse/team"
> "Absolutely. Want me to send you a one-page breakdown? It shows the cost comparison vs hiring a receptionist vs an answering service, plus the ROI math. That way they can see the numbers and you don't have to explain it all."

### "Isn't this just a glorified voicemail?"
> "That's the best question anyone asks — and the answer is no, not even close. Here's the difference: 80% of people won't leave a voicemail. They hang up and call your competitor. But the AI actually ANSWERS — it says 'Hi, how can I help you?' and has a real conversation. It asks their name, phone, email, what they need, reads it all back to confirm, and then emails everything to your team in 30 seconds. A voicemail just says 'leave a message at the beep' and prays someone talks. Call our demo line right now — (307) 464-9517 — and you'll hear the difference in 5 seconds."

### "Can I try it first?"
> "Absolutely. Call **(307) 464-9517** right now and you'll talk to Claire — she's our demo AI. That'll give you a feel for exactly what your callers would experience."

### "I already have a receptionist"
> "That's great! This isn't about replacing them — it's about catching everything they can't. After hours, weekends, holidays, lunch breaks, when they're on another call. The AI handles all of that so your receptionist can focus on in-person clients."

### "How do I know it works?"
> "I've got it running right now for a Farm Bureau insurance office in Wyoming. It's handling all their after-hours calls, collecting caller info, and emailing everything to their team automatically. I can also set up a trial so you can see it with your own calls."

### "What if callers don't like talking to an AI?"
> "Great question. The voice is super natural — most callers don't even realize it's AI. It uses the latest voice technology, not a robotic text-to-speech. You can hear it yourself at **(307) 464-9517**. People are honestly surprised."

## 6. THE CLOSE

### If they're warm:
> "So here's what I'd suggest — I can have your AI receptionist built and ready to go within a week. I'll customize it for your business, set up the email notifications to your team, and make sure everything's dialed in. Want to get started?"

### If they need a nudge:
> "Tell you what — let's do this. I'll build it out for you, we'll test it together, and if it's not exactly what you want, we'll adjust it until it is. The first invoice doesn't go out until you're happy with how it sounds. Fair enough?"

### After they say yes:
> "Awesome! Here's what I need from you to get started:
> 1. Your business name and a brief description of what you do
> 2. The email address(es) where you want call notifications sent
> 3. Any specific info you want the AI to collect from callers
> 4. Your preferred greeting style — professional, friendly, casual
>
> I'll have a first version ready for you to test within a few days."

## TIPS

- **Listen more than you talk** — the prospect should be talking 60% of the time
- **Always redirect to the demo line** — hearing is believing
- **Use Mike as a case study** — "I'm already running this for a Farm Bureau office in Wyoming"
- **Don't discount** — the value is there, hold your price
- **Follow up within 24 hours** if they say "let me think about it"
- **Ask for referrals** after every happy client
