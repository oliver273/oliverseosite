## 💵 PRICING STRUCTURE

### **Plan 1: Pay-Per-Use (Starter)**
- **Monthly Fee:** None
- **Setup Fee:** $1,500 (one-time — covers configuration, integration, testing)
- **Per Minute:** $0.90/minute (only charged for actual call time)
- **Minimum Commitment:** 3 months
- **Contract:** 3-month minimum, then month-to-month after that
- **Best For:** Smaller businesses, businesses that want to try it before committing, lower call volume

**Pay-Per-Use Math:**
| Monthly Usage | Client Pays | Your Cost ($0.11/min) | Your Profit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 min | $180 | $22 | $158 |
| 500 min | $450 | $55 | $395 |
| 1,000 min | $900 | $110 | $790 |
| 1,500 min | $1,350 | $165 | $1,185 |
| 1,889 min | $1,700 | $208 | $1,492 |
| 3,000 min | $2,700 | $330 | $2,370 |

**Upsell trigger:** When a Pay-Per-Use client hits ~1,889 min/month, their bill equals $1,700 — pitch them the Pro plan: *"Hey, you're spending $1,700+ anyway. Want to switch to the flat rate and cap your costs?"*

### **Plan 2: Pro (Flat Rate)**
- **Monthly Fee:** $1,700/month (flat rate)
- **Setup Fee:** None (included)
- **Includes:** Up to 3,000 call minutes/month
- **Overage Rate:** $0.30/minute for minutes over 3,000
- **Contract:** Month-to-month (no long-term commitment)
- **Best For:** Serious businesses, higher call volume, businesses that want predictable costs

### **What's Included (Both Plans):**
- 24/7 professional AI call handling
- Initial setup and integration
- Google Sheets integration (real-time data collection)
- Automated email delivery (real-time notifications)
- Call transcripts and recordings
- Monthly updates and optimization
- Ongoing support and maintenance
- Custom greeting and conversation flow

### **Sales Framing:**

**Pay-Per-Use pitch:**
> *"There's no monthly fee. You only pay when the AI is actually talking to a customer — 90 cents a minute. A typical call is 2-3 minutes, so you're paying about $2-3 per lead captured. Compare that to a missed call that goes to voicemail and costs you a potential $2,000 customer."*

**Pro plan pitch:**
> *"$1,700 a month flat — that's $57 a day. Less than one hour of a human receptionist. And you get 24/7 coverage, 3,000 minutes, email delivery, transcripts, recordings, and I optimize it for you every month."*

### **Market Position:**
- **Quality Rating:** 7.8/10 (Mid-Market Professional Tier)
- **Competitive Pricing:** $1,000-$2,500/month range
- **Your Pro Price:** $1,700/month ✅ (Right in the middle)
- **Your Pay-Per-Use Price:** $0.90/min ✅ (Low barrier to entry)
- **Value Proposition:** Choose fixed or flexible — both all-inclusive, no hidden fees

## 🤝 CLIENT SUCCESS & REFERRAL PLAYBOOK

### **Goal:** Keep Mike happy → Get referrals → Grow without ad spend

---

### **PHASE 1: During the Test (Now — Tuesday Feb 18)**

**Your job is to make Mike feel like he has a dedicated tech team, not just a vendor.**

1. **Monitor every single test call yourself** — don't wait for Mike or Kayleigh to find issues
2. **Send a quick daily update** (text or email) — "Hey Mike, 3 calls came through today, all captured perfectly. No issues."
3. **Fix anything before they notice** — if you see a hiccup in a transcript, fix it and tell them you already caught and resolved it
4. **Be responsive within minutes** — if they text/call with a question during the test, reply FAST. This builds trust more than anything else
5. **Over-deliver** — if you see something you can improve (greeting, flow, etc.), do it and let them know: "I noticed X and made it even better for you"

---

### **PHASE 2: After the Test Goes Well (Tuesday-Wednesday)**

**This is your window to lock in long-term happiness AND plant the referral seed.**

**Step 1: Get feedback from Kayleigh**
> "Hey Kayleigh, now that you've seen a few days of calls come through — is there anything you'd want the AI to ask that it's not asking? For example, should it ask callers for their preferred contact method — phone, email, or text? I want to make sure this works perfectly for YOUR workflow."

- This does 2 things: makes her feel heard AND improves the product
- Whatever she says, implement it quickly (same day if possible)

**Step 2: Get feedback from Mike**
> "Mike, how are you feeling about it? Is it doing what you expected? Anything you'd change?"

- Listen carefully — even small complaints are gold because fixing them fast = trust

**Step 3: Ask for a testimonial**
> "Hey Mike, if you're happy with how it's working, would you mind if I used you as a reference when I talk to other businesses? Nothing public if you don't want — just being able to say 'I run this for a Farm Bureau office in Wyoming' goes a long way."

- Most people say yes to this. It costs them nothing.

---

### **PHASE 3: The Referral Ask (After 1-2 weeks of smooth operation)**

**Don't rush this. Wait until Mike has seen real results and is genuinely happy.**

**The casual approach (best for Mike's personality):**
> "Hey Mike, I'm glad this is working well for you. Quick question — do you know any other business owners who deal with the same after-hours call problem? Insurance agents, real estate guys, anyone like that? If you send someone my way and they sign up, I'll knock $500 off your next month's invoice as a thank you."

**If he asks "who specifically?":**
> "Really anyone who misses calls — other insurance agents, financial advisors, law firms, medical offices, contractors. Anyone who's ever said 'I wish I had a receptionist after hours.'"

**If he offers multiple names:**
> "That's awesome. The deal is $500 off for every one that signs up — so if you send me 3 and they all join, that's $1,500 off. You could basically get a free month."

---

### **REFERRAL PROGRAM — THE MATH**

| Scenario | Mike's Discount | Your New Client Revenue | Your Net Gain |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| 1 referral signs up | -$500 (one-time) | +$1,700/mo recurring | +$1,200 month 1, +$1,370/mo after |
| 2 referrals sign up | -$1,000 (one-time) | +$3,400/mo recurring | +$2,400 month 1, +$2,740/mo after |
| 3 referrals sign up | -$1,500 (one-time) | +$5,100/mo recurring | +$3,600 month 1, +$4,110/mo after |
| Mike refers enough for a free month | -$1,700 (one-time) | +$5,780/mo recurring | Still massively profitable |

**Why this is your best marketing spend:**
- **Cost per client via referral:** $500 (one-time discount to Mike)
- **Cost per client via LinkedIn Ads:** $100-200 (but lower close rate)
- **Referral close rate:** 50%+ (vs 25% for cold leads)
- **Referral LTV:** Higher (referred clients stay longer and are less price-sensitive)
- **ROI on $500 referral discount:** $500 cost → $16,440 LTV = **3,188% return**

---

### **ONGOING CLIENT SUCCESS CHECKLIST (Monthly)**

Do these every month for EVERY client to keep them happy and referral-ready:

- [ ] **Week 1:** Review call data, identify any issues, optimize prompt if needed
- [ ] **Week 2:** Send a quick "monthly check-in" email with stats (total calls handled, data collected, any improvements made)
- [ ] **Week 3:** Ask if they need any changes to the greeting, flow, or data collection
- [ ] **Week 4:** Casually remind them about the referral program (if they haven't referred anyone yet)

**Monthly check-in email template:**
> Subject: Your AI Receptionist — [Month] Recap
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> Quick update on your AI receptionist this month:
> - **Calls handled:** [X]
> - **Leads captured:** [X]  
> - **Average call duration:** [X] minutes
> - **Updates made:** [list any optimizations]
>
> Everything's running smoothly. Let me know if you want any changes!
>
> And as always — if you know anyone who'd benefit from this, I'll take $500 off your next invoice for every referral that signs up.
>
> — Oliver

---

### **RULES FOR THE REFERRAL PROGRAM**

1. **$500 off Mike's next invoice** for every referral that becomes a paying client
2. **No limit** on referrals — if he sends 10 and they all sign up, that's $5,000 in discounts
3. **The discount applies once** per referral (one-time, not recurring)
4. **The referral must sign up and pay** — not just a name and number
5. **Stack discounts** — if 3 referrals sign up the same month, Mike gets $1,500 off that month
6. **If discount exceeds monthly invoice**, roll the remainder to the next month
7. **Offer the same deal to ALL clients** — not just Mike (every client can refer)

---

### **WHAT NOT TO DO**

- ❌ Don't ask for referrals before Mike is genuinely happy
- ❌ Don't make it feel transactional — keep it casual
- ❌ Don't push if he says "I can't think of anyone right now" — just say "No worries, if anyone comes to mind just shoot me their name"
- ❌ Don't discount your actual price for the new client — the $500 is Mike's reward, the new client pays full $1,700
- ❌ Don't wait too long — the best time to ask is when excitement is highest (first 2-3 weeks after launch)
