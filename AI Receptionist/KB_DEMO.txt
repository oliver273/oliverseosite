OliverSEO AI Receptionist Service Information:

What It Is:
- An AI receptionist that answers your business phone 24/7
- Sounds like a real person — callers won't know the difference
- Collects caller's name, phone number, email, and reason for calling
- Emails everything to your team instantly after every call
- Includes full call transcript and recording
- Also logs everything to a Google Sheet in real-time

How It Works:
- We set up a custom AI for YOUR business with your greeting, your call flow, your industry knowledge
- When a call comes in after hours (or anytime you want), the AI picks up
- It has a natural conversation with the caller and collects their info
- Your team gets an email within seconds with all the details
- Setup takes about a week — we handle everything

Pricing:
- Pay-Per-Use Plan: $200 per month base fee with 200 minutes included. After 200 minutes, 90 cents per minute. One-time $1,500 setup fee. 3-month minimum, then month-to-month. A typical 2-3 minute call costs about $2-3.
- Pro Plan: $1,700 per month flat rate. Includes 3,000 call minutes. No setup fee. Month-to-month, cancel anytime. Overage is 30 cents per minute over 3,000.
- HIPAA Compliance Add-On: $2,000 per month on top of either plan. For medical offices, dental, therapists, and healthcare businesses that need secure patient call handling.

Appointment Booking:
- The AI can book appointments directly into your calendar during the call
- Works with Calendly and other calendar tools
