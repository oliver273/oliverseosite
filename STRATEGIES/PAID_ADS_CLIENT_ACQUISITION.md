# 💰 PAID ADS GUIDE - Get Clients Through Advertising

**Question: What if I get someone to market for me like ads? Would that work to get a client?**

**Answer: YES, but it depends on your budget and how you do it.**

---

## ✅ SHORT ANSWER

**Paid ads CAN work, but:**
- ✅ Best for when you have $100-500/month budget
- ✅ Works better once you have a portfolio
- ✅ Requires testing and optimization
- ✅ Can be expensive if done wrong
- ❌ Not recommended if you're broke (use free methods first)

**Better approach:** Start with free methods (email, Facebook groups), then add paid ads once you have cash flow.

---

## 🎯 WHEN PAID ADS MAKE SENSE

### **Use Paid Ads If:**
- ✅ You have $100-500/month to spend
- ✅ You have a portfolio (3-5 examples)
- ✅ You've tried free methods and want to scale
- ✅ You want faster results
- ✅ You can track ROI (know if it's working)

### **Don't Use Paid Ads If:**
- ❌ You have $0 budget
- ❌ You have no portfolio yet
- ❌ You haven't tried free methods first
- ❌ You can't afford to lose $100-200 testing

**Rule of thumb:** Only use paid ads if you can afford to lose the money while testing.

## 📊 COST VS ROI BREAKDOWN

### **Realistic Expectations:**

**Facebook/Instagram Ads:**
- **Cost per click:** $1-3
- **Cost per lead:** $10-30
- **Cost per client:** $50-200

**Google Ads:**

- **Cost per lead:** $20-50
- **Cost per client:** $100-300
