---

### **Package Presentation Scripts**

```
"Based on what you told me, the Essential package at $997 would be perfect for you. Here's what you get:

✅ Professional one-page website that converts
✅ Mobile-friendly (works on all phones)
✅ Fast loading (under 3 seconds)

Does this sound like what you need?"
```

**Professional Package ($1,997) - BEST VALUE:**
```
"Based on your needs, the Professional package at $1,997 is the best value. Here's why most clients choose this:

✅ Multi-page website (up to 5 pages)

Would you like to move forward with this?"
```

**Premium Package ($4,997):**

```

---

### **Objection Handling Scripts**

**"It's Too Expensive"**
```
"I understand budget is important. Let me show you the ROI:

The Professional package is $1,997. If you get just 2-3 new customers from your website (which is very realistic - most clients get 5-10), it pays for itself immediately.

Plus, you're getting:
- A website that works 24/7 bringing you customers
- Professional credibility that builds trust
- SEO that helps you rank higher than competitors
- Support and revisions included

Would you rather spend $1,997 once and get customers for years, or keep losing customers to competitors who have better websites?

I also offer payment plans if that helps. We can split it into 2-3 payments.

What works better for you?"
```

**"I Need to Think About It"**
```
"I totally understand - this is an important decision. 

Let me ask: what specifically do you need to think about? Is it the price, the timeline, or something else?

Here's what I can tell you: I only take 5 clients per month to ensure premium quality. Right now, I have 3 spots left this month. After that, the next available slot would be [next month].

If you're ready to get more customers, I can lock in your spot today and we can start next week. 

What's your biggest concern? Let me address it so you can make the best decision."
```

**"I Already Have a Website"**
```
"That's great! Having a website is the first step. But let me ask:

- Is your current website bringing you customers?
- Does it look professional and modern?
- Is it mobile-friendly?
- Does it load fast?
- Does it rank on Google?

Most businesses have websites, but they're not getting results. My clients see 3-5x more inquiries because I build websites that actually convert, not just look pretty.

Would you like me to do a quick audit of your current site and show you what's missing? It's free and takes 5 minutes.

Or, if you're ready to upgrade, I can redesign your site to start bringing you customers. What would be most helpful?"
```

**"I'm Not Sure If I Need It"**
```
"I hear you. Let me show you what happens when you DON'T have a professional website:

- Your competitors with better websites get all the customers
- People can't find you on Google
- When they do find you, your site looks outdated and they go elsewhere
- You're losing potential customers every day

Here's what happens when you DO have a professional website:

- You get 3-5x more inquiries
- You rank higher on Google than competitors
- People trust you more (professional website = professional business)
- You stand out from everyone else

I have a guarantee: If you don't get inquiries within 30 days, I'll optimize for free.

The question isn't whether you need it - it's whether you can afford to keep losing customers to competitors who have better websites.

What do you think?"
```

**"Can You Do It Cheaper?"**
```
"I understand you want the best value. Here's what I can do:

1. The Essential package at $997 is the most affordable option - still professional and gets results
2. I can offer a payment plan: 50% now, 50% on completion
3. I can include extra bonuses (free logo, extra pages, etc.) at no extra cost

But I can't go lower on price because:
- I only take 5 clients/month to ensure quality
- I include revisions, support, and guarantees
- You're getting $3,500+ value for $1,997

What would work best for you - the Essential package, or a payment plan on the Professional?"
```

---

### **Closing Scripts**

**Direct Close:**
```
"Perfect! Let's get you started. I'll send you the contract and payment link right now. 

Once you sign and pay the 50% deposit, I'll lock in your spot and we can schedule your kickoff call for next week.

What's the best email to send the contract to?"
```

**Assumptive Close:**
```
"Great! So we're going with the Professional package at $1,997. 

I'll send you:
1. The contract (takes 2 minutes to sign)
2. Payment link (50% deposit to start = $998.50)
3. Kickoff call scheduling link

You'll be live in 7-10 days and getting customers within 30 days.

What's your email address?"
```

**Urgency Close:**
```
"I only have 3 spots left this month, and I'd love to help you get more customers.

If you're ready to move forward, I can lock in your spot right now and we can start next week. 

Would you like me to send you the contract and get you started?"
```
