## 🎯 THE STRATEGY (Validated Approach)

**Core Concept:**
1. Scrape GMB data → Get business info (name, website, phone, etc.)
2. Use Hunter.io → Get email addresses
3. Send validation emails → No mockup until they say "yes"
4. Create mockups → Only for interested prospects
5. Close sales → Send offer, get deposit

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Saves time (no mockups for uninterested people)
- ✅ Higher conversion (they already said "yes")
- ✅ Scalable (can reach 100+ businesses/week)
- ✅ Better ROI (time invested only in qualified leads)
