# $100K/MONTH PLAN - Realistic Scaling Strategy

## 🎯 THE GOAL: $100K/Month

**Reality Check:**
- This takes time (6-12 months minimum)
- Requires scaling (not just you working)
- Needs systems and processes
- But it's possible with the right strategy

---

## 📊 THE MATH

### Option 1: High-Value Clients (Best Path)
- **Premium Package: $4,997** = 20 clients/month = $99,940
- **Ultimate Package: $14,997** = 7 clients/month = $104,979
- **Mix: 10 Premium + 3 Ultimate** = $79,961

### Option 2: Recurring Revenue (Stable)
- **Monthly clients: $197/month**
- **Need: 508 clients** = $100,076/month
- **Timeline: 12-18 months to build**

### Option 3: Agency Model (Scalable)
- **Hire 5-10 developers**
- **Each does 10-15 websites/month**
- **You take 30-50% margin**
- **50 websites/month × $2,000 avg = $100k**
