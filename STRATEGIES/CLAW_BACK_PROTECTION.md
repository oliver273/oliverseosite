# 🛡️ CLAW BACK PROTECTION - How to Handle Commission Recovery

## What is Claw Back?

**Claw back** = When you pay a sales rep commission, but then:
- Client cancels before paying
- Client gets a refund
- Client doesn't pay the final 50%
- Deal falls through after commission is paid

**The Problem:** You paid commission, but didn't actually get the money (or lost it).

## 🎯 THE SOLUTION: Smart Payment Structure

### Option 1: Pay Commission on Final Payment (RECOMMENDED)

**How It Works:**
- Client pays 50% deposit → You DON'T pay commission yet
- You build the website
- Client pays final 50% → You pay commission NOW

**Why This Works:**
- If client cancels after deposit, you keep the deposit (covers your work)
- Commission only paid when you get FULL payment
- No claw back needed (you never paid commission on incomplete deals)

**Example:**
- Essential package: $997
- Deposit (50%): $498 → No commission paid
- Final payment (50%): $499 → Pay commission ($399) NOW
- If client cancels after deposit: You keep $498, no commission owed

**Tell Your Sales Rep:**
```
Commission Structure:
- Client pays 50% deposit → I start building
- Client pays final 50% → I pay you commission within 7 days
- If client cancels after deposit: No commission (they didn't complete payment)
```

### Option 2: Pay Commission on Deposit, But with Claw Back Clause

**How It Works:**
- Client pays 50% deposit → You pay commission
- If client cancels/refunds → You "claw back" the commission

**Why This is Riskier:**
- You pay commission before getting full payment
- If client cancels, you have to get commission back
- Harder to enforce (sales rep might not pay it back)

**When to Use:**
- Only if sales rep insists on deposit payment
- Only with experienced, trusted sales reps
- Only with a written contract

## 💰 PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Scenario 1: Client Completes Payment (Good)

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Sales rep closes Essential ($997)
- Day 1: Client pays deposit ($498)
- Day 7: You finish website
- Day 7: Client pays final ($499)
- Day 7: You pay commission ($399) to sales rep
- **Result:** Everyone happy, no claw back needed

---

### Scenario 2: Client Cancels After Deposit (Common)

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Sales rep closes Essential ($997)
- Day 1: Client pays deposit ($498)
- Day 3: Client cancels (changes mind)
- Day 3: You keep deposit ($498)
- Day 3: No commission paid (they didn't complete payment)
- **Result:** You're protected, no claw back needed

**Tell Sales Rep:**
```
"Client cancelled after deposit. Since they didn't complete payment, no commission is owed. 
This is why commission is paid on final payment, not deposit."
```

---

### Scenario 3: Client Requests Refund (Rare, But Possible)

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Sales rep closes Essential ($997)
- Day 1: Client pays deposit ($498)
- Day 7: Client pays final ($499)
- Day 7: You pay commission ($399) to sales rep
- Day 10: Client requests refund (unhappy with website)
- Day 10: You refund client ($997)
- Day 10: You request commission back ($399) from sales rep

**The Problem:** Sales rep might not want to return commission.

**Solutions:**

**Solution A: 30-Day Hold Period**
- Hold commission for 30 days
- If no refund requested, pay commission
- If refund requested, don't pay commission

**Solution B: Claw Back Clause in Contract**
- Contract states: "If refund within 30 days, commission must be returned"
- Enforce through contract
- May be hard to enforce if sales rep doesn't cooperate

**Solution C: Accept the Loss (If Small)**
- If refund is rare, accept the loss
- Factor it into your pricing
- Still better than paying commission on deposits

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH (For You)

### Best Practice: Pay Commission on Final Payment Only

**Why:**
- ✅ No claw back needed (commission only paid on completed deals)
- ✅ Protects you from cancellations
- ✅ Simple to explain to sales rep
- ✅ No disputes about refunds

**How to Explain to Sales Rep:**
```
Commission Structure:

1. Client pays 50% deposit → I start building
2. Client pays final 50% → I pay you commission within 7 days

Why this way?
- Protects both of us
- Commission only paid when deal is complete
- No claw back needed
- You get paid when I get paid (fair for both of us)
```

**If Sales Rep Insists on Deposit Payment:**
- Explain the risk
- Offer slightly higher commission (5% more) if they wait for final payment
- Or use claw back clause (but it's riskier)

## ⚠️ WHAT IF SALES REP WON'T RETURN COMMISSION?

### If Claw Back is Needed But Sales Rep Refuses:

**Options:**

1. **Deduct from Future Commissions:**
   - If they close another sale, deduct the claw back amount
   - Example: They owe $399, next sale commission is $500 → Pay them $101

2. **Terminate Relationship:**
   - If they won't cooperate, end the relationship
   - Don't work with them again
   - Accept the loss (if small)

3. **Legal Action (Last Resort):**
   - Only if large amount ($1000+)
   - Only if you have written contract
   - Usually not worth it for small amounts

**Best Prevention:** Pay commission on final payment only (avoids this problem)
