# ⚖️ AGE & CONTRACT ISSUES - What You Need to Know

## The Problem: You're 17, Turning 18 Soon

**Key Issue:** In most states, contracts with minors (under 18) are **voidable by the minor**, meaning:
- You can cancel the contract (if you want)
- The other party (sales rep) might not be able to enforce it against you
- This creates uncertainty for both parties

---

## 🎯 YOUR OPTIONS

### Option 1: Wait Until You're 18 (SAFEST)

**Timeline:**
- You turn 18 on the 26th
- That's about 8-11 days away
- Post job now, interview, but sign contract after you turn 18

**How It Works:**
1. **Today:** Post job, get applications
2. **Tomorrow:** Interview candidates
3. **Day 3-10:** Choose best candidate, prepare everything
4. **After you turn 18:** Sign contract, start working

**Pros:**
- ✅ No legal issues
- ✅ Contract is fully enforceable
- ✅ No questions about validity
- ✅ Professional and clean

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slight delay (but only 8-11 days)
- ❌ Sales rep might find another opportunity (unlikely if you're clear about timeline)

**Recommendation:** **This is the safest option. Worth the wait.**

### Option 2: Have Parent/Guardian Co-Sign (GOOD ALTERNATIVE)

**How It Works:**
- You sign the contract
- Parent/guardian also signs as "guarantor" or "co-signer"
- This makes the contract enforceable

**Contract Addition:**
```
**Co-Signer (if contractor is under 18):**
[Parent/Guardian Name] agrees to be bound by this agreement and guarantees performance.

[Parent/Guardian Name]
Date: ___________
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Can start immediately
- ✅ Contract is enforceable
- ✅ No delay

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires parent/guardian involvement
- ❌ They need to understand what you're doing
- ❌ Might not want to involve them

**When to Use:**
- If you have supportive parent/guardian
- If you want to start immediately
- If they're comfortable co-signing

---

### Option 3: Use Simple Agreement (Less Formal) ✅ RECOMMENDED FOR YOU

**How It Works:**
- Instead of formal "contract," use a simple "agreement" or "understanding"
- Less formal, but still sets expectations
- Can upgrade to formal contract when you turn 18
- See `TEMPLATES/SIMPLE_SALES_REP_AGREEMENT.md` for full template

**Simple Agreement Template:**
```
SALES REP AGREEMENT

This is an agreement between [Your Name] and [Sales Rep Name].

Commission: 40-50% for first client, 25-30% ongoing
Payment: Commission paid on final payment only
Termination: Either party can end at any time

Both parties agree to these terms.

[Your Name] - [Date]
[Sales Rep Name] - [Date]
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Can start immediately
- ✅ Sets expectations
- ✅ Less formal (might avoid age issues)
- ✅ Can upgrade to formal contract at 18

**Cons:**
- ❌ Less legally binding (but still better than nothing)
- ❌ Might not protect you as well as formal contract
- ❌ Still has age issues (if you're 17), but less problematic than formal contract

**When to Use:**
- If you want to start immediately
- If you're comfortable with less formal agreement
- If you'll upgrade to formal contract at 18
- **This is what you're doing!**

**Upgrade Plan:**
- Use simple agreement now (at 17)
- Work together for 8-11 days
- On your 18th birthday, upgrade to formal contract (`TEMPLATES/SALES_REP_CONTRACT.md`)
- Terms stay the same, just more formal structure

---

### Option 4: Proceed Without Contract (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**How It Works:**
- Just agree verbally or via email
- No formal contract
- Trust-based relationship

**Pros:**
- ✅ Can start immediately
- ✅ No contract issues

**Cons:**
- ❌ No legal protection
- ❌ Hard to enforce
- ❌ Risky for both parties
- ❌ No clear expectations

**Recommendation:** **Don't do this. Always use some form of agreement.**

## ⚠️ WHAT IF SALES REP ASKS ABOUT AGE?

**If They Ask:**
- "I'm 17, turning 18 on [date]. We'll sign the contract then to make sure everything is legally sound. I'm posting now to find the right person and get everything ready so we can start immediately after my birthday."

**Why This is Good:**
- ✅ Honest and transparent
- ✅ Shows you're responsible
- ✅ Professional approach
- ✅ Most people will respect this

**If They Push Back:**
- "I understand you want to start immediately. I'm committed to working with you, and we can prepare everything now. The contract will be signed on [date], and we'll start working immediately after. This protects both of us legally."

**If They Still Push:**
- They might not be the right person
- Look for someone who understands and respects your approach
- Better to wait for the right person than rush with the wrong one

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE: If You Must Start Immediately

**If you absolutely need to start before 18:**

1. **Use Simple Agreement:**
   - Less formal agreement
   - Sets basic expectations
   - Upgrade to formal contract at 18

2. **Have Parent Co-Sign:**
   - Parent/guardian co-signs
   - Makes contract enforceable
   - Requires their involvement

3. **Proceed with Understanding:**
   - Clear email agreement
   - Set expectations
   - Upgrade to contract at 18

**But honestly:** The 8-11 day wait is worth it for legal safety.

## ⚖️ LEGAL REALITY CHECK

**What Actually Happens at 17:**

1. **Contract is Voidable by You:**
   - You can cancel (if you want)
   - Sales rep can't easily enforce against you
   - Creates uncertainty

2. **But in Practice:**
   - Most contracts with 17-year-olds still work
   - People usually honor agreements
   - But it's not legally solid

3. **The Risk:**
   - If dispute happens, contract might not hold up
   - Sales rep might not want to work with you (uncertainty)
   - Better to wait for clean, enforceable contract

**Bottom Line:** Technically possible at 17, but not recommended. Wait 8-11 days.
