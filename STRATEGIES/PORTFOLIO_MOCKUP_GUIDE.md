# 🎨 PORTFOLIO MOCKUP GUIDE - Showcase Unused Designs

**Question: What if they don't buy the sites? Should I post them online as portfolio?**

**Answer: YES! But do it the right way.**

---

## ✅ WHY YOU SHOULD USE THEM

**Benefits:**
1. **Maximize ROI** - You already did the work, get value from it
2. **Build portfolio** - Shows you can create professional designs
3. **Attract clients** - More portfolio pieces = more credibility
4. **Demonstrate range** - Different industries, different styles
5. **Social proof** - "Look at all the work I've done"

**Bottom line:** Don't let good work go to waste. Use it to get more clients.

---

## ⚠️ LEGAL & ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### **What You CAN Do:**
- ✅ Showcase the design/mockup as "concept work"
- ✅ Use it as a portfolio piece
- ✅ Say "Concept design for [Business Type]"
- ✅ Use generic business names if needed
- ✅ Show the design without their actual business name/logo

### **What You SHOULD Do:**
- ✅ Label it as "Concept" or "Design Study"
- ✅ Use generic names if you're concerned (e.g., "Local Restaurant" instead of "Joe's Pizza")
- ✅ Focus on showcasing your design skills, not their business
- ✅ If you use their actual name, make it clear it's a concept/proposal

### **What to AVOID:**
- ❌ Don't claim it's a "live site" if it's not
- ❌ Don't use their logo/branding without permission (if you're concerned)
- ❌ Don't make false claims about results
- ❌ Don't use copyrighted images without permission

**Legal Reality:**
- Mockups/concepts are generally fine to showcase
- You created the design, you own the design
- They didn't pay for it, so it's yours
- Just be honest that it's a concept, not a live site

## 🎯 HOW TO PRESENT THEM PROFESSIONALLY

### **Option 1: Label as "Concept Work" (Recommended)**
