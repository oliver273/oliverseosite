## 📝 STEP 3: LEGAL PROTECTION (Contract)

### Simple Independent Contractor Agreement

**What You Need:**
- Written agreement (even if simple)
- Protects both parties
- Makes expectations clear
- Helps with disputes

**Key Sections:**

1. **Parties:**
   ```
   This agreement is between:
   - [Your Name/Business Name] ("Company")
   - [Sales Rep Name] ("Contractor")
   ```

2. **Commission Structure:**
   ```
   Commission Rates:
   - First client closed: 40-50% of total package price
   - Ongoing clients: 25-30% of total package price
   
   Commission is paid ONLY when client completes full payment (both deposit and final payment).
   Commission will be paid within 7 days of receiving client's final payment.
   Commission is NOT paid on deposits alone.
   ```

3. **Payment Timing:**
   ```
   Payment Process:
   1. Client pays 50% deposit → Company starts building
   2. Client pays final 50% → Company pays commission within 7 days
   3. If client cancels after deposit: No commission owed
   ```

4. **Cancellation Policy:**
   ```
   If client cancels after deposit but before final payment:
   - No commission is owed
   - Deposit is retained by Company to cover work completed
   ```

5. **Refund Policy:**
   ```
   If client requests refund within 30 days of final payment:
   - Commission will be clawed back (returned to Company)
   - Contractor must return commission within 14 days of refund request
   ```

6. **Independent Contractor Status:**
   ```
   Contractor is an independent contractor, not an employee.
   Contractor is responsible for their own taxes.
   Company does not provide benefits, insurance, or equipment.
   ```

7. **Termination:**
   ```
   Either party may terminate this agreement at any time with written notice.
   Commission is only paid for completed sales before termination.
   ```

8. **Confidentiality:**
   ```
   Contractor agrees not to share client information, pricing, or business strategies with competitors.
   ```

9. **Dispute Resolution:**
   ```
   Any disputes will be resolved through direct communication.
   If unresolved, commission may be withheld until resolved.
   ```

10. **Signatures:**
    ```
    [Your Name]
    Date: ___________
    
    [Sales Rep Name]
    Date: ___________
    ```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - AGE CONSIDERATION:**

- Sign contract on your 18th birthday (makes it fully enforceable)
- See `STRATEGIES/AGE_AND_CONTRACT_ISSUES.md` for full details

## 🛡️ STEP 4: BUSINESS PROTECTION

### Protection Strategy 1: Payment Timing

**Pay Commission on Final Payment Only:**
- ✅ No claw back needed (commission only paid on completed deals)
- ✅ Protects you from cancellations
- ✅ Simple to explain
- ✅ No disputes

**How It Works:**
1. Client pays deposit → No commission
2. Client pays final → Pay commission
3. If client cancels → No commission (no claw back needed)

---

### Protection Strategy 2: Quality Control

**What to Control:**
1. **Review Their Outreach:**
   - Ask them to share emails/messages
   - Make sure they're representing you well
   - Don't let them promise things you can't deliver

2. **Set Clear Boundaries:**
   - "Don't promise features we don't offer"
   - "Don't negotiate pricing without checking with me"
   - "Don't make guarantees we can't keep"

3. **Provide Scripts/Templates:**
   - Give them email templates
   - Give them objection responses
   - Give them package details
   - This ensures consistency

4. **Regular Check-ins:**
   - Daily or weekly check-ins
   - See what they're doing
   - Provide feedback
   - Catch issues early

---

### Protection Strategy 3: Track Everything

**Keep Records:**
- Sales rep name
- Client name
- Package price
- Deposit paid
- Final payment paid
- Commission paid
- Date paid
- Any issues/problems

**Why:**
- Helps with disputes
- Shows what's owed
- Protects you legally
- Makes tax time easier

**Simple Spreadsheet:**
```
Date | Sales Rep | Client | Package | Deposit | Final | Commission | Paid Date | Notes
-----|-----------|--------|---------|---------|-------|------------|----------|------
```

---

### Protection Strategy 4: Client Verification

**Before Accepting a Client:**
1. **Verify They're Real:**
   - Check their business exists
   - Check their website/social media
   - Make sure they're legitimate

2. **Get Contact Info:**
   - Business name
   - Owner name
   - Email
   - Phone number
   - Address (if needed)

3. **Confirm Package:**
   - Make sure sales rep quoted correct package
   - Make sure pricing is correct
   - Make sure expectations are clear

**Why:**
- Prevents scams
- Ensures you can deliver
- Protects your reputation

---

### Protection Strategy 5: Set Clear Expectations

**Tell Sales Rep Upfront:**
1. **What They Can Do:**
   - Find businesses
   - Reach out
   - Close sales
   - Direct to oliverseo.com

2. **What They Can't Do:**
   - Negotiate pricing (without checking)
   - Promise features we don't offer
   - Make guarantees we can't keep
   - Represent themselves as employees

3. **What Happens When They Close:**
   - They send you client info
   - You verify and send payment link
   - Client pays deposit
   - You build website
   - Client pays final
   - You pay commission

**Why:**
- Prevents misunderstandings
- Sets boundaries
- Protects your business

---

## ⚠️ STEP 5: WHAT IF THINGS GO WRONG

### Scenario 1: Sales Rep Doesn't Close Anything

**What to Do:**
1. **Check in after 1 week:**
   - "How's it going? Any leads?"
   - "How many businesses have you contacted?"
   - "Any questions?"

2. **Provide Support:**
   - Answer questions
   - Give feedback
   - Help them improve

3. **After 2-3 weeks with no results:**
   - Have honest conversation
   - "This doesn't seem to be working. Let's part ways."
   - No hard feelings (commission-only = no loss)

**Why This is OK:**
- Commission-only = no cost if they don't sell
- You can try someone else
- No loss to you

---

### Scenario 2: Sales Rep Misrepresents You

**What to Do:**
1. **Catch it early:**
   - Review their outreach
   - Check what they're promising
   - Set boundaries

2. **If it happens:**
   - "You promised X, but we don't offer that. Please don't do that again."
   - Provide correct information
   - Monitor closely

3. **If it continues:**
   - Terminate relationship
   - "This isn't working. Let's part ways."
   - Protect your reputation

**Prevention:**
- Provide scripts/templates
- Review their outreach
- Set clear boundaries upfront

---

### Scenario 3: Sales Rep Won't Return Commission (Claw Back)

**What to Do:**
1. **Try to resolve:**
   - "Client requested refund. Per our agreement, commission must be returned."
   - Reference contract
   - Give them 14 days

2. **If they refuse:**
   - Deduct from future commissions (if they close another sale)
   - Or terminate relationship
   - Accept the loss (if small)

3. **Legal action (last resort):**
   - Only if large amount ($1000+)
   - Only if you have written contract
   - Usually not worth it for small amounts

**Prevention:**
- Pay commission on final payment only (avoids this)
- Use claw back clause in contract
- Hold commission for 30 days (if needed)

---

### Scenario 4: Client Complains About Sales Rep

**What to Do:**
1. **Listen to client:**
   - What happened?
   - What did sales rep say/do?
   - How can you fix it?

2. **Address the issue:**
   - Apologize if needed
   - Correct any misinformation
   - Make it right

3. **Talk to sales rep:**
   - "Client complained about X. Please don't do that."
   - Provide feedback
   - Monitor closely

4. **If it continues:**
   - Terminate relationship
   - Protect your reputation

**Prevention:**
- Review their outreach
- Set clear boundaries
- Monitor communication
