# ACTUAL WORKING METHODS - Where You Can Actually Post

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

Reddit is blocking/restricting posts. You need methods that **actually work** and **actually allow posting**.

---

## ✅ WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY POST (No Restrictions)

### 1. Facebook Groups (BEST - Usually Allow Posting)

**Why This Works:**
- Most groups allow self-promotion (check rules first)
- Less competition than Reddit
- Better engagement
- Can post daily in multiple groups

**How to Find Groups:**
1. Facebook search: "Small Business Owners"
2. Facebook search: "Entrepreneurs Network"
3. Facebook search: "[Your City] Business"
4. Facebook search: "Website Design"
5. Facebook search: "Business Networking"

**Groups That Usually Allow Posting:**
- "Small Business Owners" (many variations)
- "Entrepreneurs Network"
- "Local Business Networking" (any city)
- "[City] Small Business"
- "Business Growth Strategies"
- "Marketing for Small Business"
- "Website Design & Development"
- "Freelance Web Developers"

**Strategy:**
1. Join 20-30 groups
2. Check each group's rules (some say "no self-promotion")
3. Post in groups that allow it
4. Reply to posts asking for help
5. Engage with other posts (build relationships)

**Post Template:**
```
