Subject: Quick question about [Business Name]'s website

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Business Name] [doesn't have a website / has an outdated website]. 

I help businesses get 3-5x more inquiries with professional websites. Most businesses I work with see results within 30 days.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call? I can show you how to get more customers online.
