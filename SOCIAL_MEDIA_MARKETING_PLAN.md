🚀 Website Tip for Wyoming Businesses

Is your website not getting you calls? Here are 3 quick fixes:

1. Make sure your phone number is BIG and easy to find
2. Add a contact form that actually works
3. Make it mobile-friendly (most people browse on phones)

Most Wyoming businesses I talk to are losing customers because their 
website is hard to use on mobile. It's a quick fix!

Need help? I design modern websites for local businesses.
