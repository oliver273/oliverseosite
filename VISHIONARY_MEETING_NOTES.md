---

## Opening (First 2-3 minutes)

**Your intro:**
"Hi, thanks for taking the time to meet. Mike mentioned that you frequently get requests from clients for website services, but you don't currently offer that. I'd love to explore how we could partner together to solve that problem for your clients while creating value for both of us."

**Key points to establish:**
- You understand their situation
- You're here to help, not just sell
- Partnership mindset, not vendor relationship

---

## Questions to Ask (Listen First!)

### Understanding Their Situation:
1. "How often do clients ask you about websites?"
2. "What types of businesses/clients typically ask?"
3. "What do you currently tell them when they ask?"
4. "Have you ever tried to offer websites before? What happened?"
5. "What's the typical budget range of clients who ask?"

### Understanding Their Business:
6. "What services does Vishionary currently provide?"
7. "What's your ideal client profile?"
8. "How do you typically acquire new clients?"
9. "What makes your clients choose Vishionary?"

### Partnership Fit:
10. "If we partnered, how would you want to present this to clients?"
11. "Would you prefer to refer clients to me, or offer it as your own service?"
12. "What would make this partnership valuable enough for you to actively promote it?"

## Key Points to Make

### 1. Solve Their Problem
- "Instead of saying 'we don't do websites,' you can say 'yes, we have a partner for that'"
- "This makes you a more complete solution for your clients"

### 2. Zero Risk, All Reward
- "No investment required from you"
- "No additional work or overhead"
- "Just refer clients, get commission"

### 3. Quality & Speed
- "Professional quality websites"
- "Fast turnaround (3-14 days depending on scope)"
- "I handle everything - you just make the introduction"

### 4. Local Connection
- "I'm available for calls and meetings"
- "Can work with Gillette, Wyoming clients"
- "Personal service, not a faceless agency"

## Partnership Models to Present

### Model 1: Referral Partnership (Easiest)
- They refer → You build → They get 15-20% commission
- **Best for:** Testing the waters, minimal commitment

### Model 2: White-Label (More Integrated)
- You build under their brand → They set pricing → They keep margin
- **Best for:** Wanting to offer it as their own service

### Model 3: Hybrid
- Mix of both based on client needs
- **Best for:** Maximum flexibility

## Objections & Responses

### "We're not sure if our clients would pay for websites"
**Response:** "That's why we start small - test with 1-2 clients. If it works, great. If not, no harm done. But I bet you'll be surprised - most businesses know they need a website."

### "We don't want to be responsible if something goes wrong"
**Response:** "I handle all client communication and support. You're just making the introduction. Once they're my client, I'm responsible for everything."

### "We're too busy to manage another partnership"
**Response:** "That's the beauty - there's nothing to manage. Just say 'I know a great web designer' and introduce us. I handle everything else."

### "What if the client isn't happy?"
**Response:** "I guarantee my work. If there's an issue, I fix it. Your relationship with the client is protected because you're just making a referral, not providing the service yourself."

## Closing the Meeting

### If They're Interested:

2. "Let's start with a test - can you think of 1-2 clients who might need a website?"
3. "I'll send you a simple referral agreement to review"
4. "When would be a good time to follow up?"

### If They Need to Think:
1. "Totally understand - this is a new idea"
2. "Can I send you some examples of my work and a simple proposal?"
3. "No pressure - just want to make sure you have all the info"
4. "When would be a good time to follow up?"

### Always End With:
- "Thanks for your time"
