# Quick Reference: Vishionary Partnership Pitch

## 30-Second Pitch

"You get clients asking for websites, but you don't offer that service. I can handle all those requests for you. You just refer them to me, I build their website, and you get 15-20% commission. Zero work for you, happy clients, extra revenue."
