# 💰 RENT TO RANK - Your Recurring Revenue Model

## 🎯 WHAT IS "RENT TO RANK"?

**"Rent to Rank"** is a business model where you **rent your SEO services** to clients on a **monthly recurring basis** instead of selling one-time projects.

### The Concept:
- ✅ Client pays you **monthly** (like rent)
- ✅ You maintain their **search rankings** (like a landlord maintains a property)
- ✅ **Recurring revenue** - money comes in every month
- ✅ **Predictable income** - you know how much you'll make

**It's like being a landlord, but for SEO rankings.**

## 💬 YOUR SALES SCRIPT

### Opening:
```
"Hi [Name],

I noticed [their business] and thought you might benefit from ongoing SEO 
services to get more customers from Google.

Instead of paying thousands upfront, I offer a monthly SEO service where 
you pay $199/month and I maintain your search rankings. As long as you 
pay, your rankings stay up. Cancel anytime if it's not working.

Would you be open to a quick conversation to see if this could help 
[their business] get more customers?"
```

### If They Ask About Cost:
```
"Great question! I offer three packages:

• Starter: $199/month - Basic SEO maintenance
• Professional: $499/month - Advanced SEO + content
• Enterprise: $999/month - Full SEO service

Most businesses start with Professional at $499/month. That includes:
- Monthly SEO audits
- 4-5 blog posts/month
- Link building
- Ranking tracking
- Monthly reports

The best part? You can cancel anytime if it's not working. No long-term 
contracts. No risk."
```

### If They Say "Too Expensive":
```
"I understand. Let me ask - how much is a new customer worth to you?

If you get just 1 new customer per month from Google, and that customer 
is worth $500+, then $199/month is a great investment.

Plus, you can cancel anytime if it's not working. No risk.

Would you be open to starting with the Starter package at $199/month 
to test it out?"
```
