## 💰 PRICING FOR QUICK SALES

**LOWER YOUR PRICES FOR SPEED:**

**Article Writing:**
- Quick: $29 (500 words, 24h) - NORMALLY $39
- Standard: $59 (1000 words, 48h) - NORMALLY $79

**Website Design:**
- Quick: $199 (1 page, 3 days) - NORMALLY $249
- Standard: $399 (5 pages, 5 days) - NORMALLY $499

**Why lower?**
- You need quick sales
- $199 + $29 = $228 (2 clients) is still money
- You can raise prices after Thanksgiving
- Speed > price right now
