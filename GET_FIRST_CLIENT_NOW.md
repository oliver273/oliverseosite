Hey [Name]!

I just started a web design business and I'm looking for my first client to build my portfolio.

Do you know any business owners who need a website or have an outdated one?

I'm offering a really good deal for my first few clients - professional website for $750-1500 (normally $2500+).

If you know anyone, I'd really appreciate the intro!
```

### If They Say "I Need One":

```
Oh awesome! What kind of business is it?

I could do a free consultation call and show you exactly what I'd build. Takes 15 minutes.

When works for you - today or tomorrow?
```

### Action Steps (Do Today):
1. [ ] List 20 people you know (or your parents know)
2. [ ] Send 20 messages
3. [ ] Follow up in 24 hours if no response

## 🥈 #2: "FREE WORK FOR TESTIMONIAL" (Hormozi Method)

**Success rate: 50%+ (offering free)**
**Time to close: 1-2 days**

### The Concept:
Offer to build a FREE website in exchange for:
- Testimonial (video preferred)
- Case study rights
- 3 referrals
- They pay for domain/hosting through you

### Who to Target:
- Local small businesses with NO website
- Businesses with terrible/outdated websites
- New businesses (just opened)
- Businesses you actually use

### How to Find Them:
1. Google "[your city] [business type]" - look for ones with no website
2. Drive around - look for businesses with no website on their sign
3. Facebook - search "[your city] small business"
4. Yelp - filter by "no website"

### The Script (DM/Email):

```
Hey [Business Name]!

I noticed you don't have a website (or your website looks outdated).

I'm a web designer building my portfolio and I'd like to offer you a FREE professional website.

What's the catch? I just need:
✅ A testimonial after it's done
✅ Permission to use it in my portfolio
✅ 3 referrals to other business owners

The website would normally cost $1,500+. You'd just pay for domain ($15/year) and hosting ($10/month) if you want me to set that up.

Interested? I can have it done in 7 days.
