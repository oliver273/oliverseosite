### 3. BUILD KARMA FIRST (CRITICAL!)

**Why Karma Matters:**
- Many subreddits require minimum karma to post
- Higher karma = more credibility
- Prevents spam filters

**How to Build Karma Fast:**

#### Day 1-2: Comment Only (Don't Post Yet)

**Find Posts to Comment On:**
- Go to r/entrepreneur
- Go to r/smallbusiness
- Go to r/startups
- Go to r/freelanceWriters

**Comment Strategy:**
- Be helpful and genuine
- Answer questions
- Share insights
- Don't self-promote yet

**Example Comments:**

```
Post: "How do I improve my website's SEO?"

Your Comment:
"Great question! Here are 3 quick wins:
1. Add meta descriptions to all pages
2. Use header tags (H1, H2) properly
3. Create quality blog content regularly

I've found that consistent content creation is the biggest SEO boost for small businesses. Start with 1-2 articles per month and build from there.

Good luck!"
```

```
Post: "Need advice on content marketing"

Your Comment:
"Content marketing works best when you:
- Focus on solving your audience's problems
- Be consistent (even 1 article/month helps)
- Promote your content on social media
- Repurpose content (turn articles into social posts)

The key is starting small and being consistent. Don't try to do too much at once!"
```

**Goal:** Get 50-100 karma in first 2 days

#### Day 3-5: Continue Building

- Comment on 10-20 posts/day
- Upvote helpful content
