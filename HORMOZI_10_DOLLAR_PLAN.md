# The Hormozi $10 Start Plan

## How Alex Hormozi Would Make This Profitable Starting With $10

---

## Hormozi's Core Principle

**"Do things that don't scale to learn what works, then scale what works."**

With $10, you can't run ads. But you CAN:
1. Give away free value to get leads
2. Build proof (testimonials, portfolio)
3. Create an upsell engine
4. THEN run ads once you have cash flow

---

## THE FREE WEBSITE GIVEAWAY FUNNEL

### The Concept

**You offer:** 1 FREE website/week (or month)
**They give you:** Email, testimonial, and referrals
**You upsell:** Domain, hosting, maintenance, additional pages

### Why This Works (Hormozi Logic)

1. **Lead Magnet** - Free website attracts TONS of leads
2. **Proof** - You get testimonials and portfolio pieces
3. **Upsells** - They need domain/hosting (recurring revenue!)
4. **Referrals** - Happy clients tell friends
5. **Email List** - Everyone who enters becomes a warm lead

---

## THE EXACT FUNNEL

### Step 1: Create the Giveaway Landing Page

**Headline:**
"Win a FREE $1,500 Professional Website"

**What they get:**
- Free professional website (Essential package)
- Free SEO setup
- Free logo design
- Free hosting setup

**What you get:**
- Their email
- Their business info
- Permission to contact them
- A testimonial (if they win)

**Everyone who enters:**
- Gets on your email list
- Gets a "consolation offer" (discounted website)
- Becomes a warm lead

### Step 2: Pick a Winner (Weekly or Monthly)

**Selection criteria:**
- Business that would make a good portfolio piece
- Someone who will give a great testimonial
- Someone with referral potential

**Announce winner:**
- Post on social media
- Email everyone who entered
- Creates FOMO for next giveaway

### Step 3: Upsell the Winner

**The "free" website is just the start:**

| Upsell | Price | Recurring? |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Domain registration | $15-20/year | Yes |
| Hosting setup | $10-15/month | Yes |
| Monthly maintenance | $50-100/month | Yes |
| Additional pages | $100-300 each | No |
| SEO package | $200-500/month | Yes |
| Logo design (premium) | $150-300 | No |

**Even if website is free, you can make:**
- Domain: $15
- Hosting: $10/month x 12 = $120/year
- Maintenance: $50/month x 12 = $600/year
- **Total from "free" client: $735/year**

### Step 4: Convert Non-Winners

**Email the losers:**
```
Subject: You didn't win, but here's something better...

## THE MATH (Hormozi Style)

### Scenario: 100 people enter giveaway

| Outcome | Number | Revenue |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Winner (free site) | 1 | $0 (but upsells below) |
| Winner upsells | 1 | $200-500 |
| Non-winner conversions (5%) | 5 | $750 x 5 = $3,750 |
| Future conversions (from email list) | 2-3 | $1,500 x 2 = $3,000 |
| **Total** | | **$7,450+** |

**Cost:** $0 (organic promotion) or $10-50 (if boosted)
**ROI:** Infinite (or 150x if boosted)
