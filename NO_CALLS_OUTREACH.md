## Why No Websites = GOLD

Businesses on Google Maps WITHOUT websites:
- Already spending time on their business (made a Google profile)
- KNOW they need online presence
- Have zero options right now
- Easier sell than "your website sucks"

**Your pitch:** "I can help you get more customers" (not "your site is bad")

## FINDING PROSPECTS ON GOOGLE MAPS

### Step 1: Search Google Maps
```
"plumber" in Wyoming
"electrician" in Casper
"HVAC" in Cheyenne
"roofer" in Laramie
```

### Step 2: Look for These Signs
- ❌ No website link (just phone/address)
- ❌ "Website: facebook.com/businessname" (they need a real site)
- ❌ Website link that's broken/dead
- ✅ They have reviews (means they're active)
- ✅ They have photos (means they care about their business)

### Step 3: Get Their Contact Info
From Google Maps you can get:
- Phone number (for text)
- Sometimes email (click "About" or check their Facebook)
- Facebook page (for Messenger)

## RESPONDING TO REPLIES

### If They Say "Yes, interested"
```
Great! Here's what I can do for you:

I build simple, professional websites for local businesses. 
Your site would include:
- Professional design with your branding
- Mobile-friendly (works on phones)
- Easy for customers to contact you
- Shows up better on Google

Pricing starts at $997 for a basic site.

Would you like me to put together a specific quote for your 
business? I just need to know:
1. What pages do you want? (Home, Services, About, Contact?)
2. Do you have a logo and photos?
3. Any specific features you need?
```

### If They Say "What's the price?"
```
Great question! Here are my packages:

📦 Essential ($997): 1-page site, mobile-friendly, basic SEO
📦 Professional ($1,997): 5-page site, custom design, SEO
📦 Premium ($4,997): 10-page site, full branding, advanced SEO

Most [plumbers/contractors] go with Professional - it's the 
best balance of features and value.

All packages include:
- 100% satisfaction guarantee
- Unlimited revisions until you're happy
- Free hosting setup

Which sounds closest to what you need?
```

### If They Say "Too expensive"
```
I totally understand - it's an investment.

A few options:
1. Payment plan - split into 2-3 monthly payments
2. Essential package - $997 for a simpler site
3. Start smaller and upgrade later

Also worth considering: if your website brings in just 
2 extra jobs per month, it pays for itself quickly.

What works best for your budget?
```

### If They Say "I'll think about it"
```
No problem at all! Take your time.

Is there anything specific I can answer for you? 
Or any concerns I can address?

Feel free to reach out whenever you're ready. 
I'll be here.
```

### If They Say "Not right now"
```
Totally understand! When do you think might be a 
better time?

I can check back in [time period] if that helps.

In the meantime, feel free to keep my info in case 
you need anything.
