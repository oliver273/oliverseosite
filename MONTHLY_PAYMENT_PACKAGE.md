## 💬 FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION

### If They Respond Positively:

**You:**
```
Awesome! Here's how it works:

**What You Get:**
- Professional website (mobile-friendly)
- Domain name (yourbusiness.com)
- Hosting (included)
- Contact form
- Basic SEO
- 2 rounds of revisions

**Monthly Cost:** $99/month
**Commitment:** 12 months (then month-to-month)

**Timeline:** I'll have your site live in 5-7 days after we start.

**Questions?** Happy to answer anything!

Would you like to set up a quick call or just chat here?
```

### If They Ask About Price:

**You:**
```
Great question! The monthly plan is $99/month for 12 months, or 
$79/month if you commit to 24 months.

This includes:
- The website (normally $1,500-$2,500 upfront)
- Domain name ($15/year)
- Hosting ($30/month)
- Setup and design

So you're getting everything for less than most people pay just for 
hosting, and no big upfront cost.

Does that work for your budget?
```

### If They Say "Too Expensive":

**You:**
```
I understand budget is important! Let me ask - how much is a new 
customer worth to you?

If your website brings in just 1-2 new customers per month, the 
$99/month pays for itself.

Plus, you can cancel after 12 months if it's not working. But I'm 
confident it will - I've seen it work for other small businesses.

Would you be open to starting with a 6-month commitment at $119/month? 
That way you can test it out.

## 🎯 HOW TO PRESENT IT

### The Pitch:

**"I have a monthly payment plan that makes it affordable for small 
businesses. Instead of paying $1,500-$2,500 upfront, you pay $99/month 
for 12 months. This includes your website, domain name, hosting, and 
everything. No big upfront investment."**

1. **No Big Upfront Cost** - Easy to say yes
2. **Everything Included** - No surprises
3. **Affordable Monthly** - Fits small business budget
4. **Professional Quality** - Same quality as upfront clients
5. **Can Cancel** - After commitment period

### Objections to Handle:

**"What if I want to cancel?"**
"After 12 months, you can cancel anytime with 30-day notice. You keep 
the website files, and I'll help you transfer hosting if needed."

**"What if I don't like it?"**
"You get 2 revisions during setup to make sure you love it. Plus, 
after 12 months you can cancel if it's not working. But I'm confident 
it will - I've seen it work for other small businesses."

**"Can I pay upfront later?"**
"Absolutely! If you want to pay the remaining balance upfront after a 
few months, we can do that. Or you can just keep the monthly plan."
